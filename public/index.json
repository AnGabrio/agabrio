To improve the quality (and harmonize the generation process) of such evidence, many HTA agencies have established methodological guidelines describing the normative framework inspiring their decision-making process. The information requirements that economic evaluation analyses for HTA must satisfy typically involve the use of complex quantitative syntheses of multiple available datasets, handling mixtures of aggregate and patient-level information, and the use of sophisticated statistical models for the analysis of non-Normal data (e.g. time-to-event, quality of life and costs). Much of the recent methodological research in economic evaluation for healthcare has developed in response to these needs, in terms of sound statistical decision-theoretic foundations, and is increasingly being formulated within a Bayesian paradigm. The rationale for this preference lies in the fact that by taking a probabilistic approach, based on decision rules and available information, a Bayesian economic evaluation study can explicitly account for relevant sources of uncertainty in the decision process and produce information to identify an optimal course of actions.  Moreover, the Bayesian approach naturally allows the incorporation of an element of judgement or evidence from different sources (e.g.~expert opinion or multiple studies) into the analysis. This is particularly important when, as often occurs in economic evaluation for HTA, the evidence base is sparse and requires some inevitable mathematical modelling to bridge the gaps in the available data. The availability of free and open source software in the last two decades has greatly reduced the computational costs and facilitated the application of Bayesian methods and has the potential to improve the work of modellers and regulators alike, thus advancing the fields of economic evaluation of health care interventions. This chapter provides an overview of the areas where Bayesian methods have contributed to the address the methodological needs that stem from the normative framework adopted by a number of HTA agencies.","tags":["Economic Evaluations","Bayesian Statistics"],"title":"Bayesian Statistical Economic Evaluation Methods for Health Technology Assessment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Gabrio","R Hunter","AJ Mason","G Baio"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"59de577875bb81ae76f7296d27d711a0","permalink":"/publication/gabrio2019d/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gabrio2019d/","section":"publication","summary":"Failure to account for baseline utilities/costs imbalance between treatment groups in cost-effectiveness analyses can result in biased estimates and mislead the decision making process. The currently recommended adjustment approach is linear regression, with estimates that are typically evaluated at the mean of the baseline utilities/costs. However, a problem arises whenever there are some missing follow-up values and the evaluation is restricted to the complete cases. Should the mean of the complete cases or the available cases baseline utilities/costs be used in generating the adjusted estimates? To our knowledge there is no current guideline about this choice in the literature, with standard software implementations often implicitly selecting one of the methods. We use two trials as motivating examples to show that the two approaches can lead to substantially different conclusions for healthcare decision making and that standard approaches which automatically resort to complete case analysis are potentially dangerous and biased. Analysts should therefore consider methods that can explicitly incorporate missing data assumptions and assess the robustness of the results to a range of plausible alternatives.","tags":["Missing Data","Economic Evaluations"],"title":"Pitfalls of adjusting for mean baseline utilities/costs in trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis with missing data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Gabrio","AJ Mason","G Baio"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554076800,"objectID":"e4282ca40728b2e297a1792c11cd58b6","permalink":"/publication/gabrio2019a/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gabrio2019a/","section":"publication","summary":"Economic evaluations from individual?level data are an important component of the process of technology appraisal, with a view to informing resource allocation decisions. A critical problem in these analyses is that both effectiveness and cost data typically present some complexity (eg, nonnormality, spikes, and missingness) that should be addressed using appropriate methods. However, in routine analyses, standardised approaches are typically used, possibly leading to biassed inferences. We present a general Bayesian framework that can handle the complexity. We show the benefits of using our approach with a motivating example, the MenSS trial, for which there are spikes at one in the effectiveness and missingness in both outcomes. We contrast a set of increasingly complex models and perform sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the conclusions to a range of plausible missingness assumptions. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach with a second example, the PBS trial, and extend the framework to accommodate the characteristics of the data in this study. This paper highlights the importance of adopting a comprehensive modelling approach to economic evaluations and the strategic advantages of building these complex models within a Bayesian framework.

JAGS is a free software based on the Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling (informally BUGS) language at the base of WinBUGS/OpenBUGS but, unlike these programs, it is written in C++ and is platform independent. The latest version of JAGS can be dowloaded from Martyn Plummer’s repository and is available for different OS. There are different R packages which function as frontends for JAGS. These packages make it easy to process the output of Bayesian models and present it in publication-ready form. In this brief introduction, I will specifically focus on the R2jags package (Su et al. (2015)) and show how to fit JAGS models using this package.\n\rInstalling JAGS and R2jags\rInstall the latest version of JAGS for your OS. Next, install the package R2jags from within R or Rstudio, via the package installer or by typing in the command line\n\u0026gt; install.packages(\u0026quot;R2jags\u0026quot;, dependencies = TRUE)\rThe dependencies = TRUE option will automatically install all the packages on which the functions in the R2jags package rely.\n\r\rBasic model\rSimulate data\rFor an example dataset, I simulate my own data in R. I create a continuous outcome variable \\(y\\) as a function of one predictor \\(x\\) and a disturbance term \\(\\epsilon\\). I simulate a dataset with 100 observations. Create the error term, the predictor and the outcome using a linear form with an intercept \\(\\beta_0\\) and slope \\(\\beta_1\\) coefficients, i.e.\n\\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon \\]\nThe R commands which I use to simulate the data are the following:\n\u0026gt; n.sim=100; set.seed(123)\r\u0026gt; x=rnorm(n.sim, mean = 5, sd = 2)\r\u0026gt; epsilon=rnorm(n.sim, mean = 0, sd = 1)\r\u0026gt; beta0=1.5\r\u0026gt; beta1=1.2\r\u0026gt; y=beta0 + beta1 * x + epsilon\rThen, I define all the data for JAGS in a list object\n\u0026gt; datalist=list(\u0026quot;y\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;x\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;n.sim\u0026quot;)\r\rModel file\rNow, I write the model for JAGS and save it as a text file named \"basic.mod.txt\" in the current working directory\n\u0026gt; basic.mod= \u0026quot;\r+ model {\r+ #model\r+ for(i in 1:n.sim){\r+ y[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau)\r+ mu[i] = beta0 + beta1 * x[i]\r+ }\r+ #priors\r+ beta0 ~ dnorm(0, 0.01)\r+ beta1 ~ dnorm(0, 0.01)\r+ tau ~ dgamma(0.01,0.01)\r+ }\r+ \u0026quot;\rThe part of the model inside the for loop denotes the likelihood, which is evaluated for each individual in the sample using a Normal distribution parameterised by some mean mu and precision tau (where, precision = 1/variance). The covariate x is included at the mean level using a linear regression, which is indexed by the intercept beta0 and slope beta1 terms. The second part defines the prior distributions for all parameters of the model, namely the regression coefficients and the precision. Weakly informative priors are used since I assume that I do not have any prior knowledge about these parameters.\nTo write and save the model as the text file “basic.mod.txt” in the current working directory, I use the writeLines function\n\u0026gt; writeLines(basic.mod, \u0026quot;basic.mod.txt\u0026quot;)\r\rPre-processing\rDefine the parameters whose posterior distribtuions we are interested in summarising later and set up the initial values for the MCMC sampler in JAGS\n\u0026gt; params=c(\u0026quot;beta0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;beta1\u0026quot;)\r\u0026gt; inits=function(){list(\u0026quot;beta0\u0026quot;=rnorm(1), \u0026quot;beta1\u0026quot;=rnorm(1))}\rThe function creates a list that contains one element for each parameter, which gets assigned a random draw from a normal distribution as a strating value for each chain in the model. For simple models like this, it is generally easy to define the intial values for all parameters. However, for more complex models, this may not be immediate and a lot of trial and error may be required. However, JAGS can automatically select the initial values for all parameters in an efficient way even for relatively complex models. This can be achieved by setting inits=NULL, which is then passed to the jags function in R2jags.\nBefore using R2jags for the first time, you need to load the package, and you may want to set a random seed number for making your estimates replicable\n\u0026gt; library(R2jags)\r\u0026gt; set.seed(123)\r\rFit the model\rNow, we can fit the model in JAGS using the jags function in the R2jags package and save it in the object basic.mod\n\u0026gt; basic.mod=jags(data = datalist, inits = inits,\r+ parameters.to.save = params, n.chains = 2, n.iter = 9000, + n.burnin = 1000, model.file = \u0026quot;basic.mod.txt\u0026quot;)\rCompiling model graph\rResolving undeclared variables\rAllocating nodes\rGraph information:\rObserved stochastic nodes: 100\rUnobserved stochastic nodes: 3\rTotal graph size: 406\rInitializing model\rWhile the model is running, the function prints out some information related to the Bayesian graph (corresponding to the specification used for the model) underneath JAGS, such as number of observed and unobserved nodes and graph size.\n\rPost-processing\rOnce the model has finished running, a summary of the posteiror estimates and convergence diagnostics for all parameters specified can be seen by typing print(basic.mod) or, alternatively,\n\u0026gt; print(basic.mod$BUGSoutput$summary)\r mean sd 2.5% 25% 50% 75% 97.5% Rhat n.eff\rbeta0 1.5 0.293 0.95 1.3 1.5 1.7 2.1 1 1600\rbeta1 1.2 0.053 1.07 1.1 1.2 1.2 1.3 1 920\rdeviance 278.9 2.508 276.04 277.1 278.2 279.9 285.5 1 2000\rThe posterior distribution of each parameter is summarised in terms of:\n\rThe mean, sd and some percentiles\rPotential scale reduction factor Rhat and effective sample size n.eff (Gelman (2013)). The first is a measure to assess issues in convergence of the MCMC algorithm (typically a value below \\(1.05\\) for all parameters is considered ok).

STAN is a free software and a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models using a specific class of MCMC algorithms known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods (HMC). The latest version of STAN can be dowloaded from the web repository and is available for different OS. There are different R packages which function as frontends for STAN. These packages make it easy to process the output of Bayesian models and present it in publication-ready form. In this brief introduction, I will specifically focus on the rstan package (Stan Development Team (2018)) and show how to fit STAN models using this package.\n\rInstalling STAN and rstan\rUnlike other Bayesian software, such as JAGS or OpenBUGS, it is not required to separately install the program and the corresponding frontend R package. Indeed, installing the R package rstan will automatically install STAN on your machine. However, you will also need to make sure to having installed on your pc a C++ compiler which is used by rstan to fit the models. Under a Windows OS, for example, this can be done by installing Rtools, a collection of resources for building packages for R, which is freely available from the web repository.\nNext, install the package rstan from within R or Rstudio, via the package installer or by typing in the command line\n\u0026gt; install.packages(\u0026quot;rstan\u0026quot;, dependencies = TRUE)\rThe dependencies = TRUE option will automatically install all the packages on which the functions in the rstan package rely.\n\r\rBasic model\rSimulate data\rFor an example dataset, I simulate my own data in R. I create a continuous outcome variable \\(y\\) as a function of one predictor \\(x\\) and a disturbance term \\(\\epsilon\\). I simulate a dataset with 100 observations. Create the error term, the predictor and the outcome using a linear form with an intercept \\(\\beta_0\\) and slope \\(\\beta_1\\) coefficients, i.e.\n\\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon \\]\nThe R commands which I use to simulate the data are the following:\n\u0026gt; n.sim=100; set.seed(123)\r\u0026gt; x=rnorm(n.sim, mean = 5, sd = 2)\r\u0026gt; epsilon=rnorm(n.sim, mean = 0, sd = 1)\r\u0026gt; beta0=1.5\r\u0026gt; beta1=1.2\r\u0026gt; y=beta0 + beta1 * x + epsilon\rThen, I define all the data for STAN in a list object\n\u0026gt; datalist=list(\u0026quot;y\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;x\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;n.sim\u0026quot;)\r\rModel file\rNow, I write the model for STAN and save it as a stan file named \"basic.mod.stan\" in the current working directory\n\u0026gt; basic.mod= \u0026quot;\r+ data {\r+ int\u0026lt;lower=0\u0026gt; N;\r+ vector[N] y;\r+ vector[N] x;\r+ }\r+ parameters {\r+ real beta0;\r+ real beta1;\r+ real\u0026lt;lower=0\u0026gt; sigma;\r+ }\r+ transformed parameters {\r+ vector[N] mu;\r+ mu=beta0 + beta1*x;\r+ } + model {\r+ sigma~uniform(0,100);\r+ beta0~normal(0,1000);\r+ beta1~normal(0,1000);\r+ y~normal(mu,sigma);\r+ }\r+ + \u0026quot;\rSTAN models are written using an imperative programming language, which means that the order in which you write the elements in your model file matters, i.e. you first need to define your variables (e.g. integers, vectors, matrices, etc.), the constraints which define the range of values your variable can take (e.g. only positive values for standard deviations), and finally define the relationship among the variables (e.g. one is a liner function of another).\nA Stan model is defined by six program blocks:\n\rData (required). The data block reads external information – e.g. data vectors, matrices, integers, etc.\rTransformed data (optional). The transformed data block allows for preprocessing of the data – e.g. transformation or rescaling of the data.\rParameters (required). The parameters block defines the sampling space – e.g. parameters to which prior distributions must be assigned.\rTransformed parameters (optional). The transformed parameters block allows for parameter processing before the posterior is computed – e.g. tranformation or rescaling of the parameters.\rModel (required). In the model block we define our posterior distributions – e.g. choice of distributions for all variables.\rGenerated quantities (optional). The generated quantities block allows for postprocessing – e.g. backtranformation of the parameters using the posterior samples.\r\rFor this introduction I consider a very simple model which only requires the specification of four blocks in the STAN model. In the data block, I first define the size of the sample N as a positive integer number using the expression int\u0026lt;lower=0\u0026gt; N; then I declare the two variables y and x as reals (or vectors) with length equal to N. In the parameters block, I define the coefficients for the linear regression beta0 and beta1 (as two real numbers) and the standard deviation parameter sigma (as a positive real number). In the transformed parameters block, I define the conditional mean mu (a real vector of length N) as a linear function of the intercept beta0, the slope beta1, and the covariate x. Finally, in the model block, I assign weakly informative priors to the regression coefficients and the standard deviation parameters, and I model the outcome data y using a normal distribution indexed by the conditional mean mu and the standard deviation sd parameters. I note that STAN in many cases uses sampling statements which can be vectorized, i.e. you do not need to use for loops statements.\nTo write and save the model as the text file “basic.mod.stan” in the current working directory, I use the writeLines function\n\u0026gt; writeLines(basic.mod, \u0026quot;basic.mod.stan\u0026quot;)\r\rPre-processing\rDefine the parameters whose posterior distribtuions we are interested in summarising later and set up the initial values for the MCMC sampler in STAN\n\u0026gt; params=c(\u0026quot;beta0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;beta1\u0026quot;)\r\u0026gt; inits=function(){list(\u0026quot;beta0\u0026quot;=rnorm(1), \u0026quot;beta1\u0026quot;=rnorm(1))}\rThe function creates a list that contains one element for each parameter, which gets assigned a random draw from a normal distribution as a strating value for each chain in the model. For simple models like this, it is generally easy to define the intial values for all parameters in the object inits which is then passed to the stan function in rstan. However, for more complex models, this may not be immediate and a lot of trial and error may be required. However, STAN can automatically select the initial values for all parameters randomly. This can be achieved by setting inits=\"random\", which is then passed to the stan function in rstan.\nBefore using rstan for the first time, you need to load the package, and you may want to set a random seed number for making your estimates replicable\n\u0026gt; library(rstan)\r\u0026gt; set.seed(123)\r\rFit the model\rNow, we can fit the model in STAN using the stan function in the rstan package and save it in the object basic.mod\n\u0026gt; #basic.mod\u0026lt;-stan(data = datalist, pars = params, \u0026gt; # iter = 9000, warmup = 1000, chains = 2, file = \u0026quot;basic.mod.stan\u0026quot;)\rGelman, Andrew, Daniel Lee, and Jiqiang Guo. 2015. “Stan: A Probabilistic Programming Language for Bayesian Inference and Optimization.” Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics 40 (5): 530–43.\n\rStan Development Team. 2018. “RStan: The R Interface to Stan.” http://mc-stan.org/.\n\r\r\r\r","date":1532398394,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532398394,"objectID":"16a77cc23dd55d8ba6afba62a396f822","permalink":"/stan/basic-introduction-to-stan/super-basic-introduction-to-stan/","publishdate":"2018-07-23T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/stan/basic-introduction-to-stan/super-basic-introduction-to-stan/","section":"STAN","summary":"The focus of this simple tutorial is to provide a brief introduction and overview about how to fit Bayesian models using STAN via R.\nPrerequisites:\n\rThe latest version of R, which can be downloaded and installed for Windows, Mac or Linux OS from the CRAN website\rI also strongly recommend to download and install Rstudio, an integrated development environment which provides an “user-friendly” interaction with R (e.g. many drop-down menus, tabs, customisation options)\r\rPreliminaries\rWhat is STAN?","tags":["linear regression","STAN","introduction"],"title":"Super basic introduction to STAN","type":"STAN"},{"authors":["Andrea Gabrio"],"categories":["R"],"content":"\rThe focus of this simple tutorial is to provide a brief introduction and overview about how to fit Bayesian models using OpenBUGS via R.\nPrerequisites:\n\rThe latest version of R, which can be downloaded and installed for Windows, Mac or Linux OS from the CRAN website\rI also strongly recommend to download and install Rstudio, an integrated development environment which provides an “user-friendly” interaction with R (e.g. many drop-down menus, tabs, customisation options)\r\rPreliminaries\rWhat is OpenBUGS?\rOpenBUGS is a program for analysis of Bayesian models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (Spiegelhalter et al.

The latest version of OpenBUGS can be dowloaded from the web repository and is available for different OS. There are different R packages which function as frontends for OpenBUGS. These packages make it easy to process the output of Bayesian models and present it in publication-ready form. In this brief introduction, I will specifically focus on the R2OpenBUGS package (Sturtz, Ligges, and Gelman (2010)) and show how to fit OpenBUGS models using this package.\n\rInstalling OpenBUGS and R2OpenBUGS\rInstall the latest version of OpenBUGS for your OS.

The covariate x is included at the mean level using a linear regression, which is indexed by the intercept beta0 and slope beta1 terms. The second part defines the prior distributions for all parameters of the model, namely the regression coefficients and the precision. Weakly informative priors are used since I assume that I do not have any prior knowledge about these parameters.\nTo write and save the model as the text file “basicmodbugs.txt” in the current working directory, I use the writeLines function\n\u0026gt; writeLines(basic.mod, \u0026quot;basicmodbugs.txt\u0026quot;)\r\rPre-processing\rDefine the parameters whose posterior distribtuions we are interested in summarising later and set up the initial values for the MCMC sampler in OpenBUGS\n\u0026gt; params=c(\u0026quot;beta0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;beta1\u0026quot;)\r\u0026gt; inits=function(){list(\u0026quot;beta0\u0026quot;=rnorm(1), \u0026quot;beta1\u0026quot;=rnorm(1), \u0026quot;tau\u0026quot;=rgamma(1,1,1))}\rThe function creates a list that contains one element for each parameter, which gets assigned a random draw from a normal distribution as a strating value for each chain in the model.

However, because of the way these measures are collected, they are prone to missing data, which can ultimately affect the decision of whether an intervention is good value for money. We examine how missing cost and effect outcome data are handled in RCT-based CEAs, complementing a previous review (covering 2003-2009, 88 articles) with a new systematic review (2009-2015, 81 articles) focussing on two different perspectives. First, we provide guidelines on how the information about missingness and related methods should be presented to improve the reporting and handling of missing data. We propose to address this issue by means of a quality evaluation scheme, providing a structured approach that can be used to guide the collection of information, elicitation of the assumptions, choice of methods and considerations of possible limitations of the given missingness problem. Second, we review the description of the missing data, the statistical methods used to deal with them and the quality of the judgement underpinning the choice of these methods. Our review shows that missing data in within-RCT CEAs are still often inadequately handled and the overall level of information provided to support the chosen methods is rarely satisfactory.
