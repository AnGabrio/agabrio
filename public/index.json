Although not as popular as football or basketball, volleyball is a team sport with both national and international level competitions in almost every country. However, there is almost no study investigating the prediction of volleyball game outcomes and team rankings in national leagues. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for the prediction of the rankings of volleyball national teams, which also allows to estimate the results of each match in the league. We consider two alternative model specifications of different complexity which are validated using data from the women's volleyball Italian Serie A1 2017-2018 season.","tags":["Bayesian methods","Volleyball","Hierarchical Models"],"title":"Bayesian Hierarchical Models for the Prediction of Volleyball Results","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrea Gabrio"],"categories":["news","Christmas"],"content":"I did not have much time to post anything this month until now as it has been a quite busy period. I have been involved in many different works and I have also involved other people in what I think could be some very interesting new projects. Not that I complain about having many different things to do (most of them are actually cool) but doing everything in a short period is not the best.\nA couple of things have come/are coming up. First, I have seriously started working on the coding of a decision model for some health economic evaluation project I have been involved in since last year. Everything seems ok after I spent lots of days and time fixing some small bugs in my code. I am about half way through the model and I hope I will be able to finish it before Christmas (I doubt it though).\nSecond, I have finished reviewing an interesting paper about some new methods for improving current practice for dealing with missing data, which I kinda enjoy reading (very good!).\nThird, I would like to quickly summarise my first experience at ISPOR Europe in Copenhagen. I was really excited to attend this conference which, as expected, revealed itself as huge with people coming from all over the world and with many interesting sessions and discussion topics. I had the chance to meet new and old people, such as professor Andrea Manca and the always very kind Chris Sampson for whom I was like a stalker asking for more and more information about himself and his work. I also met some of my old collegues from MapiGroup, now under ICON plc. It was very fun to hang out with these old friends and see what they have been up to during this time. Among them, I gladly caught up with my dear friend Ryan Pulleyblank, now doing a PhD at the University of Southern Denmark. My poster was a success with (unexpectedly) many people stopping by and asking for more information on my work. I was genuinely surprised by this as ISPOR is mostly a conference dedicated to companies rather than academic works and networking. To sum up, it was a very nice and fun experience and despite the level of statistical methodology was not particularly high I enjoyed my time there and I also had the chance to visit Copenhagen for the first time.\nFinally, as a side note, I have found the time to upload on my arXiv page a nice application of Bayesian hierarchical models for the prediction of volleyball matches which I have been working on the past summer, taking inspiration from the work of Gianluca about predicting football macthes. I hope my work can turn out in something cool as well.\nThis is all for the moment but soon I will be heading back to another quite busy period for me. I hope this will be the last for some time, especially given that Christmas is coming and I would like to have some free time to properly enjoy this period, which I really like, even more than Christmas itself.\n","date":1573257600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573299243,"objectID":"4d4989c8f96fb85ba1f81a1451bbaa83","permalink":"/post/update-november/update-november/","publishdate":"2019-11-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/update-november/update-november/","section":"post","summary":"I did not have much time to post anything this month until now as it has been a quite busy period.

I included two main features to the previous version of the package.\nFirst, I have added a new type of identifying restriction when fitting pattern mixture models through the function \u0026ldquo;pattern\u0026rdquo;. Before, only the complete case restriction was available, which identifies the distributions of the missing data with those from the completers. Now the alternative available case restriction is can also be selected, which relies on the distributions that can be identified among the non-completers to identify the distributions of the missing data. In this way, people can choose among at least two options for the type of restrictions and compare how this choice may affect the final estimates.\nSecond, I added a new accessory function called \u0026ldquo;ppc\u0026rdquo;, which allows to perform posterior predictive checks using the conditional parameters saved from the fitted model to generate replications of the data at each posterior iteration of the model. The function implements a relatively large number of checks, mostly taken from the R package bayesplot, which allow to assess the fit of the model to the observed data by type of outcome (effects and costs) and treatment group (control and intervention). For example, overalyed density plots can be generated to compare the empirical and replicated densities of the data to detect possible failures of the model.\n\rDensity plots for the observed and replicated data\r\r\rI feel this is very important as when fitting a Bayesian model it is crucial to assess whether the model seems to adequately capture the different characteristics of the observed data (e.g. skewness, structural values, etc.). A wide range of predictive checks are available, including histograms (see thumbnail pciture), scatterplots, error intervals, empirical cumulative distribution fucntions, statistcis of interest and many others. In addition , these checks can be performed for each type of missingness model and parametric distribution chosen within missingHE.\nOf course, it is important to remember that, when dealing with missing data the fit of the model can only be checked with respect to the observed values and therefore this check is only partial since the fit to the unibserved values can never be checked. This is also why it is not meaningful to assess the fit of a model fitted under a missing not at random assumption because this is based on information which is not directly available from the data at hand and thus impossible to check.\n","date":1569369600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569411243,"objectID":"cbb05f40714cf0203644f57a8c8c1d48","permalink":"/post/missinghe-121/missinghe-version121/","publishdate":"2019-09-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/missinghe-121/missinghe-version121/","section":"post","summary":"I have finally found some time to update the version for my R package missingHE, for which version 1.2.1 is now available on CRAN.

I will now briefly summarise the main argument of the paper and then add some personal comments.\nEssentially, the article describes the characteristics of the dominant school of medical statistics and highlights the logical fallacy at the heart of the typical frequentist analysis in clinical studies. This is based on a deductive inferential approach, which starts with a given hypothesis and makes conclusions under the assumption that the hypothesis is true. This is in contrast with a inductive approach, which uses the observed evidence to evaluate what hypothesis is most tenable. The two most popular methods of the frequentist paradigm are the P value proposed by Fisher and the hypothesis testing developed by Neyman and Pearson.\nThe P value is defined as the probability, under the assumption of no effect (null hypothesis), of obtaining a result equal to or more extreme than what was actually observed. Fisher proposed it as an informal index to be used as a measure of discrepancy between the data and the null hypothesis and therefore should not be interpreted as a formal inferential method. For example, since the P value can only be calculated on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, it cannot be a direct measure of the probability that the null hypothesis is false. However, the main criticism to the P value is perhaps that it does not take into account the size of the observed effect, i.e. a small effect in a study with a large sample size can have the same P value as a large effect in a small study.\nHypothesis testing was proposed by Neyman and Pearson as an alternative approach to the P value, which assumes the existence of a null hypothesis (e.g. no effect) and an alternative hypothesis (e.g. nonzero effect). The outcome of the test is then simply to reject one hypothesis in favour of the other, solely based on the data. This exposes the researcher to two types of errors: type I error or false-positive ($\\alpha$) and type II error or false-negative ($\\beta$) result. Rather than focussing on single experiments, like the P value, hypothesis testing is effectively based on a deductive approach to minimise the errors over a large number of experiments. However, the price to pay to obtain this objectivity is the impossibility to make any inferential statement about a single experiment. The procedure only guarantees that in the long run, i.e. after considering many experiments, we shall not often be wrong.\nOver time a combination between the P value and hypothesis testing was developed under the assumption that the two approaches can be complementary. The idea was that the P value could be used to measure evidence in a single experiment while not violating the long run logic of hypothesis testing. The combined method is characterized by setting $\\alpha$ and power $\\beta$ before the experiment, then calculating a P value and rejecting the null hypothesis if the P value is less than the preset type I error rate. This means that the P value is considered a false-positive error rate specific to the data and also a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis. The P value fallacy is born from this statement, which assumes that an event can be seen simultaneously from a long run perspective (where the observed results are put together with other results that might have occurred in hypothetical repetitions of the experiment) and from a short run perspective (where the observed results are interpreted only with respect to the single experiment). However, these views are not reconcilable since a result cannot be at the same time an interchangeable (long-run) and unique (short-run) member of a group of results.\nI personally find this discussion fascinating and I believe that it is important to recognise the inconsistencies between the two alternative approaches to inference. The original authors of the two paradigms were well aware of the implications of their methods and never supported the combination of these. However, the combined approach has somehow become widely accepted in practice while its internal inconsistencies and conceptual limitations are hardly recognised.\nI feel that, since the two methods are perceived as \u0026ldquo;objective\u0026rdquo;, it is generally accepted that, if combined, they can produce reliable conclusions. This, however, is not necessarily true. Accepting at face value the significance result as a binary indicator of whether or not a relation is real is dangeroues and potentially misleading. This practice wants to show that conclusions are being drawn directly from the data, without any external influence, because direct inference from data to hypothesis is thought to result in mistaken conclusions only rarely and is therefore regarded as \u0026ldquo;scientific\u0026rdquo;.\nThis misguided approach has led to a much stronger emphasis towards the quantitative results alone (without any external input). In contrast, I believe that such perspective has the serious drawback of ignoring potentially useful information which is available (e.g. relevant medical knowledge or historical data) and which should be included in the analysis. Of course, I am aware of the potential issues that may arise from the selection and incorporation of external evidence, but I believe this should not be considered as \u0026ldquo;less reliable\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;more prone to mistakes\u0026rdquo; compared with the evidence from the available data. It is important that an agreement is reached about the selection of the type of evidence and methods to be used to perform the analysis solely based on their relevance with respect to the context analysed.\n","date":1564790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565004843,"objectID":"2e3b25e6b65aa152b5e106f8693672fa","permalink":"/post/p-value-fallacy/p-value-fallacy/","publishdate":"2019-08-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/p-value-fallacy/p-value-fallacy/","section":"post","summary":"Today, I would like to briefly comment an interesting research article written by Goodman, who provided a clear and exemplary discussion about the typical incorrect interpretation of a standard frequentist analysis in the field of medical research.

STAN is a free software and a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models using a specific class of MCMC algorithms known as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods (HMC). The latest version of STAN can be dowloaded from the web repository and is available for different OS. There are different R packages which function as frontends for STAN. These packages make it easy to process the output of Bayesian models and present it in publication-ready form. In this brief introduction, I will specifically focus on the rstan package (Stan Development Team (2018)) and show how to fit STAN models using this package.\n\rInstalling STAN and rstan\rUnlike other Bayesian software, such as JAGS or OpenBUGS, it is not required to separately install the program and the corresponding frontend R package. Indeed, installing the R package rstan will automatically install STAN on your machine. However, you will also need to make sure to having installed on your pc a C++ compiler which is used by rstan to fit the models. Under a Windows OS, for example, this can be done by installing Rtools, a collection of resources for building packages for R, which is freely available from the web repository.\nNext, install the package rstan from within R or Rstudio, via the package installer or by typing in the command line\n\u0026gt; install.packages(\u0026quot;rstan\u0026quot;, dependencies = TRUE)\rThe dependencies = TRUE option will automatically install all the packages on which the functions in the rstan package rely.\n\r\rBasic model\rSimulate data\rFor an example dataset, I simulate my own data in R. I create a continuous outcome variable \\(y\\) as a function of one predictor \\(x\\) and a disturbance term \\(\\epsilon\\). I simulate a dataset with 100 observations. Create the error term, the predictor and the outcome using a linear form with an intercept \\(\\beta_0\\) and slope \\(\\beta_1\\) coefficients, i.e.\n\\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon \\]\nThe R commands which I use to simulate the data are the following:\n\u0026gt; n_sim=100; set.seed(123)\r\u0026gt; x=rnorm(n_sim, mean = 5, sd = 2)\r\u0026gt; epsilon=rnorm(n_sim, mean = 0, sd = 1)\r\u0026gt; beta0=1.5\r\u0026gt; beta1=1.2\r\u0026gt; y=beta0 + beta1 * x + epsilon\r\u0026gt; n_sim=as.integer(n_sim)\rThen, I define all the data for STAN in a list object\n\u0026gt; datalist=list(\u0026quot;y\u0026quot;=y,\u0026quot;x\u0026quot;=x,\u0026quot;n_sim\u0026quot;=n_sim)\r\rModel file\rNow, I write the model for STAN and save it as a stan file named \"basic.mod.stan\" in the current working directory\n\u0026gt; basic.mod= \u0026quot;\r+ data {\r+ int\u0026lt;lower=0\u0026gt; n_sim;\r+ vector[n_sim] y;\r+ vector[n_sim] x;\r+ }\r+ parameters {\r+ real beta0;\r+ real beta1;\r+ real\u0026lt;lower=0\u0026gt; sigma;\r+ }\r+ transformed parameters {\r+ vector[n_sim] mu;\r+ mu=beta0 + beta1*x;\r+ } + model {\r+ sigma~uniform(0,100);\r+ beta0~normal(0,1000);\r+ beta1~normal(0,1000);\r+ y~normal(mu,sigma);\r+ }\r+ + \u0026quot;\rSTAN models are written using an imperative programming language, which means that the order in which you write the elements in your model file matters, i.e. you first need to define your variables (e.g. integers, vectors, matrices, etc.), the constraints which define the range of values your variable can take (e.g. only positive values for standard deviations), and finally define the relationship among the variables (e.g. one is a liner function of another).\nA Stan model is defined by six program blocks:\n\rData (required). The data block reads external information – e.g. data vectors, matrices, integers, etc.\rTransformed data (optional). The transformed data block allows for preprocessing of the data – e.g. transformation or rescaling of the data.\rParameters (required). The parameters block defines the sampling space – e.g. parameters to which prior distributions must be assigned.\rTransformed parameters (optional). The transformed parameters block allows for parameter processing before the posterior is computed – e.g. tranformation or rescaling of the parameters.\rModel (required). In the model block we define our posterior distributions – e.g. choice of distributions for all variables.\rGenerated quantities (optional). The generated quantities block allows for postprocessing – e.g. backtranformation of the parameters using the posterior samples.\r\rFor this introduction I consider a very simple model which only requires the specification of four blocks in the STAN model. In the data block, I first define the size of the sample n_sim as a positive integer number using the expression int\u0026lt;lower=0\u0026gt; n_sim; then I declare the two variables y and x as reals (or vectors) with length equal to N. In the parameters block, I define the coefficients for the linear regression beta0 and beta1 (as two real numbers) and the standard deviation parameter sigma (as a positive real number). In the transformed parameters block, I define the conditional mean mu (a real vector of length N) as a linear function of the intercept beta0, the slope beta1, and the covariate x. Finally, in the model block, I assign weakly informative priors to the regression coefficients and the standard deviation parameters, and I model the outcome data y using a normal distribution indexed by the conditional mean mu and the standard deviation sigma parameters. In many cases, STAN uses sampling statements which can be vectorised, i.e. you do not need to use for loop statements.\nTo write and save the model as the text file “basic.mod.stan” in the current working directory, I use the writeLines function\n\u0026gt; writeLines(basic.mod, \u0026quot;basic.mod.stan\u0026quot;)\r\rPre-processing\rDefine the parameters whose posterior distribtuions we are interested in summarising later and set up the initial values for the MCMC sampler in STAN\n\u0026gt; params=c(\u0026quot;beta0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;beta1\u0026quot;)\r\u0026gt; inits=function(){list(\u0026quot;beta0\u0026quot;=rnorm(1), \u0026quot;beta1\u0026quot;=rnorm(1))}\rThe function creates a list that contains one element for each parameter, which gets assigned a random draw from a normal distribution as a strating value for each chain in the model. For simple models like this, it is generally easy to define the intial values for all parameters in the object inits which is then passed to the stan function in rstan. However, for more complex models, this may not be immediate and a lot of trial and error may be required. However, STAN can automatically select the initial values for all parameters randomly. This can be achieved by setting inits=\"random\", which is then passed to the stan function in rstan.\nBefore using rstan for the first time, you need to load the package, and you may want to set a random seed number for making your estimates replicable\n\u0026gt; library(rstan)\r\u0026gt; set.seed(123)\r\rFit the model\rNow, we can fit the model in STAN using the stan function in the rstan package and save it in the object basic.mod\n\u0026gt; basic.mod\u0026lt;-stan(data = datalist, pars = params, iter = 9000, + warmup = 1000, init = inits, chains = 2, file = \u0026quot;basic.mod.stan\u0026quot;)\rSAMPLING FOR MODEL \u0026#39;basic\u0026#39; NOW (CHAIN 1).\rChain 1: Chain 1: Gradient evaluation took 0 seconds\rChain 1: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 0 seconds.\rChain 1: Adjust your expectations accordingly!\rChain 1: Chain 1: Chain 1: Iteration: 1 / 9000 [ 0%] (Warmup)\rChain 1: Iteration: 900 / 9000 [ 10%] (Warmup)\rChain 1: Iteration: 1001 / 9000 [ 11%] (Sampling)\rChain 1: Iteration: 1900 / 9000 [ 21%] (Sampling)\rChain 1: Iteration: 2800 / 9000 [ 31%] (Sampling)\rChain 1: Iteration: 3700 / 9000 [ 41%] (Sampling)\rChain 1: Iteration: 4600 / 9000 [ 51%] (Sampling)\rChain 1: Iteration: 5500 / 9000 [ 61%] (Sampling)\rChain 1: Iteration: 6400 / 9000 [ 71%] (Sampling)\rChain 1: Iteration: 7300 / 9000 [ 81%] (Sampling)\rChain 1: Iteration: 8200 / 9000 [ 91%] (Sampling)\rChain 1: Iteration: 9000 / 9000 [100%] (Sampling)\rChain 1: Chain 1: Elapsed Time: 0.078 seconds (Warm-up)\rChain 1: 0.593 seconds (Sampling)\rChain 1: 0.671 seconds (Total)\rChain 1: SAMPLING FOR MODEL \u0026#39;basic\u0026#39; NOW (CHAIN 2).\rChain 2: Chain 2: Gradient evaluation took 0 seconds\rChain 2: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 0 seconds.\rChain 2: Adjust your expectations accordingly!\rChain 2: Chain 2: Chain 2: Iteration: 1 / 9000 [ 0%] (Warmup)\rChain 2: Iteration: 900 / 9000 [ 10%] (Warmup)\rChain 2: Iteration: 1001 / 9000 [ 11%] (Sampling)\rChain 2: Iteration: 1900 / 9000 [ 21%] (Sampling)\rChain 2: Iteration: 2800 / 9000 [ 31%] (Sampling)\rChain 2: Iteration: 3700 / 9000 [ 41%] (Sampling)\rChain 2: Iteration: 4600 / 9000 [ 51%] (Sampling)\rChain 2: Iteration: 5500 / 9000 [ 61%] (Sampling)\rChain 2: Iteration: 6400 / 9000 [ 71%] (Sampling)\rChain 2: Iteration: 7300 / 9000 [ 81%] (Sampling)\rChain 2: Iteration: 8200 / 9000 [ 91%] (Sampling)\rChain 2: Iteration: 9000 / 9000 [100%] (Sampling)\rChain 2: Chain 2: Elapsed Time: 0.078 seconds (Warm-up)\rChain 2: 0.594 seconds (Sampling)\rChain 2: 0.672 seconds (Total)\rChain 2: \rDifferent packages are available to perform diagnostic checks for Bayesian models.

Although this may seem a complex procedure compared with simply fitting a linear model under the frequentist framework, however, the real advantages of Bayesian methods become evident when the complexity of the analysis is increased (which is often the case in real applications). Indeed, the flexibility in Bayesian modelling allows to account for increasingly complex models in a relatively easy way. In addition, Bayesian methods are ideal when the interest is in taking into account the potential impact that different sources of uncertainty may have on the final results, as they allow the natural propagation of uncertainty throughout each quantity in the model.\n\rReferences\rGabry, J, and T Mahr. 2017. “Bayesplot: Plotting for Bayesian Models.” R Package Version 1.\n\rGelman, Andrew, Daniel Lee, and Jiqiang Guo. 2015. “Stan: A Probabilistic Programming Language for Bayesian Inference and Optimization.” Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics 40 (5): 530–43.\n\rStan Development Team. 2018. “RStan: The R Interface to Stan.” http://mc-stan.org/.\n\r\r\r","date":1562206394,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562206394,"objectID":"16a77cc23dd55d8ba6afba62a396f822","permalink":"/stan/basic-introduction-to-stan/super-basic-introduction-to-stan/","publishdate":"2019-07-03T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/stan/basic-introduction-to-stan/super-basic-introduction-to-stan/","section":"STAN","summary":"The focus of this simple tutorial is to provide a brief introduction and overview about how to fit Bayesian models using STAN via R.\nPrerequisites:\n\rThe latest version of R, which can be downloaded and installed for Windows, Mac or Linux OS from the CRAN website\rI also strongly recommend to download and install Rstudio, an integrated development environment which provides an “user-friendly” interaction with R (e.g. many drop-down menus, tabs, customisation options)\r\rPreliminaries\rWhat is STAN?","tags":["linear regression","STAN","introduction"],"title":"Super basic introduction to STAN","type":"STAN"},{"authors":["Andrea Gabrio"],"categories":["R"],"content":"\rThe focus of this simple tutorial is to provide a brief introduction and overview about how to fit Bayesian models using OpenBUGS via R.\nPrerequisites:\n\rThe latest version of R, which can be downloaded and installed for Windows, Mac or Linux OS from the CRAN website\rI also strongly recommend to download and install Rstudio, an integrated development environment which provides an “user-friendly” interaction with R (e.g. many drop-down menus, tabs, customisation options)\r\rPreliminaries\rWhat is OpenBUGS?\rOpenBUGS is a program for analysis of Bayesian models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (Spiegelhalter et al.

The latest version of OpenBUGS can be dowloaded from the web repository and is available for different OS. There are different R packages which function as frontends for OpenBUGS. These packages make it easy to process the output of Bayesian models and present it in publication-ready form. In this brief introduction, I will specifically focus on the R2OpenBUGS package (Sturtz, Ligges, and Gelman (2010)) and show how to fit OpenBUGS models using this package.\n\rInstalling OpenBUGS and R2OpenBUGS\rInstall the latest version of OpenBUGS for your OS. Next, install the package R2OpenBUGS from within R or Rstudio, via the package installer or by typing in the command line\n\u0026gt; install.packages(\u0026quot;R2OpenBUGS\u0026quot;, dependencies = TRUE)\rThe dependencies = TRUE option will automatically install all the packages on which the functions in the R2OpenBUGS package rely.\n\r\rBasic model\rSimulate data\rFor an example dataset, I simulate my own data in R.

The covariate x is included at the mean level using a linear regression, which is indexed by the intercept beta0 and slope beta1 terms. The second part defines the prior distributions for all parameters of the model, namely the regression coefficients and the precision. Weakly informative priors are used since I assume that I do not have any prior knowledge about these parameters.\nTo write and save the model as the text file “basicmodbugs.txt” in the current working directory, I use the writeLines function\n\u0026gt; writeLines(basic.mod, \u0026quot;basicmodbugs.txt\u0026quot;)\r\rPre-processing\rDefine the parameters whose posterior distribtuions we are interested in summarising later and set up the initial values for the MCMC sampler in OpenBUGS\n\u0026gt; params=c(\u0026quot;beta0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;beta1\u0026quot;)\r\u0026gt; inits=function(){list(\u0026quot;beta0\u0026quot;=rnorm(1), \u0026quot;beta1\u0026quot;=rnorm(1), \u0026quot;tau\u0026quot;=rgamma(1,1,1))}\rThe function creates a list that contains one element for each parameter, which gets assigned a random draw from a normal distribution as a strating value for each chain in the model.

At first I thought this structure of the sessions was strange, but after attending many sessions and experiencing this for my own paper, I feel that it is a very good way to encourage discussion about works from different people rather than just focussing on your own presentation. Plus, the weather and always sunny, it felt like Italy for a few days.\n\rThe beautiful Norwich\u0026rsquo;s cathedral\r\r\rOther nice people and colleagues from HEART and other UCL department came to HESG with me, including Caroline and Ekaterina (aka Katia), you can see them in thumbnail of this post. I was also pleased to meet Baptiste from LSHTM, who shares with me the interest in missing data methods for cost-effectiveness analysis and who presented some very nice work on that. I had the chance to give some feedback to him and he did the same for me. It felt so nice when we started discussing about some aspects of our analyses and after some minutes we simply lost track of time and everyone else disappeared. I also had the opportunity to talk about my work with the discussant of my session, Catrin Plumpton from the Centre for Health Economics and Medicines Evaluation, who gave me some nice feedback which I really appreciated, especially given her mathematical background.\nAn important contribution to the success of the meeting was also given by the wonderful organisation of the event, including an accommodation located very closely to the main building of the meeting, plenty of food provided during each day, a nice bus tour of the city and a wonderful conference dinner. I must thank all the people, who organised the event who were very extremely nice to us and who were always ready to help us for whatever need we had, with a special mention for Emma Mcmanus who was amazing.\nIn summary, everything was good. Well, almost. Going back to the works presented, as usual, the only less positive note that I would like to make is the almost total absence of Bayesian applications. Some authors mentioned that they used some popular Bayesian program, such as WinBUGS, but this was mainly related to the usual meta-analysis stuff which is pretty standardised. I hope next time I will be able to see more people going Bayesian as this is what I am.\n","date":1562112000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562326443,"objectID":"39454d30ea7c6161ee89bc00abd6b10b","permalink":"/post/hesg-norwich-2019/hesg-summer-meeting-2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hesg-norwich-2019/hesg-summer-meeting-2019/","section":"post","summary":"I have just come back form my first Health Economists\u0026rsquo; Study Group (HESG) meeting, which this year was held at the University of East Anglia in the beautiful city of Norwich, south east of England, and where I presented some preliminary results from one of my on-going works.

HEART is a new group of health economists who are based in UCL’s Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology (ICTM), led by Rachael Hunter, and is involved at different levels in the economic components of clinical trials in different trial units at UCL. This short course was aimed at ICTM staff who are not health economists (e.g. trial managers, CIs/PIs, statisticians, data managers, research assistants, etc.) and was designed in response to the need we have identified over the last few years in working on trials as well as in response to colleagues across ICTM. This course was unique as it was intended specifically for non health economists working in trials, who wish to better understand the health economics in their study, and/or the health economist on their study. The course used a mix of lectures, group discussions and practical exercises to help participants consolidate their learning and see how to apply information from the sessions to real studies. No prior knowledge of health economics was assumed.\nI believe the course was a success both in terms of the quality/quantity of the material covered during the six sessions throughout the day, as well as in terms of the positive feedback we received from the participants (almost entirely women, with the exception of two men). Many key and typically not well understood economic topics were discussed during the day, e.g. what are and how QALYs and costs are calculated, the potential limitations and issues of an economic analysis within a trial, or the role played by the protocol and analysis plan in the economic evaluation. My session was related to reporting and interpreting health economic results and I realised that most people who do not routinely deal with health economics may find difficult to grasp certain concepts or tools used in the economic analysis (e.g. what is a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve and how it can be computed). Nevertheless, I must admit that I was surprised by how many people were very motivated to learn these concepts and these \u0026ldquo;difficult\u0026rdquo; methods, often asking questions and making good comments (despite the fact that my session was the last of the course at the end of the day).\nWe ran this course as a trial as we did not have clear ideas of what an optimal design should be or the number of topics that should be covered for this type of course. We are now confident that the course has a solid structure and that there is a clear demand to learn the basic concepts of health economics, at least among people involved in trial analyses. Following the successful delivery of the course, we are planning to replicate the experience in the future, improving certain aspects of the sessions based on the feedback we received and also considering to open the course to meet the demand of a wider audience.\nI have to say that this was an extremely positive experience for me as it was the first time I was involved in this type of projects. Me and my colleagues worked hard to design and prepare the different sessions of the course over the last few months, find the best way to link the arguments across the sessions, provide interesting group activities and materials for the practicals, etc. I have to thank all my colleagues who contributed to the promotion and realisation of this project, with a special mention for Caroline Clarke, who spent a lot of time and effort to organise the course and who personally contributed in giving one of the session of the course. Finally, I would also like to thank my colleague and health economist Ekaterina, with whom I had the pleasure to share the presentation and practical of my session in the course.\nPerhaps the only true negative aspect of the course was the absence of a Bayesian perspective, especially related to the interpretation of the results and the statistical methods that can be used to perform the analysis. Given the generally low familiarity of the people attending the course with statistics, I believe it was reasonable not to further confuse them with another new element into the picture. However, I truly hope that people will become more and more familiar with the importance of using tailored statistical methods in economic evaluations to avoid biased results, and from that point to justify a Bayesian approach, well, at least for me, the step is straightforward!.\n","date":1562112000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562153643,"objectID":"32751f66aea8e2316ec4874bd6c1d290","permalink":"/post/introduction-to-health-economics/understanding-health-economics-in-clinical-trials/","publishdate":"2019-07-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/introduction-to-health-economics/understanding-health-economics-in-clinical-trials/","section":"post","summary":"As member of the Health Economics Analysis and Research Methods Team (HEART), together with my colleagues, on Tuesday 2 July I took part in a 1-day introductory short course entitled “Understanding health economics in clinical trials”, which was designed and delivered by the team.

JAGS is a free software based on the Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling (informally BUGS) language at the base of WinBUGS/OpenBUGS but, unlike these programs, it is written in C++ and is platform independent. The latest version of JAGS can be dowloaded from Martyn Plummer’s repository and is available for different OS. There are different R packages which function as frontends for JAGS. These packages make it easy to process the output of Bayesian models and present it in publication-ready form. In this brief introduction, I will specifically focus on the R2jags package (Su et al. (2015)) and show how to fit JAGS models using this package.\n\rInstalling JAGS and R2jags\rInstall the latest version of JAGS for your OS. Next, install the package R2jags from within R or Rstudio, via the package installer or by typing in the command line\n\u0026gt; install.packages(\u0026quot;R2jags\u0026quot;, dependencies = TRUE)\rThe dependencies = TRUE option will automatically install all the packages on which the functions in the R2jags package rely.\n\r\rBasic model\rSimulate data\rFor an example dataset, I simulate my own data in R. I create a continuous outcome variable \\(y\\) as a function of one predictor \\(x\\) and a disturbance term \\(\\epsilon\\). I simulate a dataset with 100 observations. Create the error term, the predictor and the outcome using a linear form with an intercept \\(\\beta_0\\) and slope \\(\\beta_1\\) coefficients, i.e.\n\\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon \\]\nThe R commands which I use to simulate the data are the following:\n\u0026gt; n.sim=100; set.seed(123)\r\u0026gt; x=rnorm(n.sim, mean = 5, sd = 2)\r\u0026gt; epsilon=rnorm(n.sim, mean = 0, sd = 1)\r\u0026gt; beta0=1.5\r\u0026gt; beta1=1.2\r\u0026gt; y=beta0 + beta1 * x + epsilon\rThen, I define all the data for JAGS in a list object\n\u0026gt; datalist=list(\u0026quot;y\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;x\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;n.sim\u0026quot;)\r\rModel file\rNow, I write the model for JAGS and save it as a text file named \"basic.mod.txt\" in the current working directory\n\u0026gt; basic.mod= \u0026quot;\r+ model {\r+ #model\r+ for(i in 1:n.sim){\r+ y[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau)\r+ mu[i] = beta0 + beta1 * x[i]\r+ }\r+ #priors\r+ beta0 ~ dnorm(0, 0.01)\r+ beta1 ~ dnorm(0, 0.01)\r+ tau ~ dgamma(0.01,0.01)\r+ }\r+ \u0026quot;\rThe part of the model inside the for loop denotes the likelihood, which is evaluated for each individual in the sample using a Normal distribution parameterised by some mean mu and precision tau (where, precision = 1/variance). The covariate x is included at the mean level using a linear regression, which is indexed by the intercept beta0 and slope beta1 terms. The second part defines the prior distributions for all parameters of the model, namely the regression coefficients and the precision. Weakly informative priors are used since I assume that I do not have any prior knowledge about these parameters.\nTo write and save the model as the text file “basic.mod.txt” in the current working directory, I use the writeLines function\n\u0026gt; writeLines(basic.mod, \u0026quot;basic.mod.txt\u0026quot;)\r\rPre-processing\rDefine the parameters whose posterior distribtuions we are interested in summarising later and set up the initial values for the MCMC sampler in JAGS\n\u0026gt; params=c(\u0026quot;beta0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;beta1\u0026quot;)\r\u0026gt; inits=function(){list(\u0026quot;beta0\u0026quot;=rnorm(1), \u0026quot;beta1\u0026quot;=rnorm(1))}\rThe function creates a list that contains one element for each parameter, which gets assigned a random draw from a normal distribution as a strating value for each chain in the model. For simple models like this, it is generally easy to define the intial values for all parameters. However, for more complex models, this may not be immediate and a lot of trial and error may be required. However, JAGS can automatically select the initial values for all parameters in an efficient way even for relatively complex models. This can be achieved by setting inits=NULL, which is then passed to the jags function in R2jags.\nBefore using R2jags for the first time, you need to load the package, and you may want to set a random seed number for making your estimates replicable\n\u0026gt; library(R2jags)\r\u0026gt; set.seed(123)\r\rFit the model\rNow, we can fit the model in JAGS using the jags function in the R2jags package and save it in the object basic.mod\n\u0026gt; basic.mod=jags(data = datalist, inits = inits,\r+ parameters.to.save = params, n.chains = 2, n.iter = 2000, + n.burnin = 1000, model.file = \u0026quot;basic.mod.txt\u0026quot;)\rCompiling model graph\rResolving undeclared variables\rAllocating nodes\rGraph information:\rObserved stochastic nodes: 100\rUnobserved stochastic nodes: 3\rTotal graph size: 406\rInitializing model\rWhile the model is running, the function prints out some information related to the Bayesian graph (corresponding to the specification used for the model) underneath JAGS, such as number of observed and unobserved nodes and graph size.\n\rPost-processing\rOnce the model has finished running, a summary of the posteiror estimates and convergence diagnostics for all parameters specified can be seen by typing print(basic.mod) or, alternatively,\n\u0026gt; print(basic.mod$BUGSoutput$summary)\r mean sd 2.5% 25% 50% 75% 97.5% Rhat n.eff\rbeta0 1.5 0.294 0.95 1.3 1.5 1.7 2.1 1 2000\rbeta1 1.2 0.054 1.07 1.1 1.2 1.2 1.3 1 2000\rdeviance 278.8 2.475 276.03 277.1 278.2 279.9 285.1 1 2000\rThe posterior distribution of each parameter is summarised in terms of:\n\rThe mean, sd and some percentiles\rPotential scale reduction factor Rhat and effective sample size n.eff (Gelman (2013)). The first is a measure to assess issues in convergence of the MCMC algorithm (typically a value below \\(1.05\\) for all parameters is considered ok). The second is a measure which assesses the adequacy of the posterior sample (typically values close to the total number of iterations are desirable for all parameters).\r\rThe deviance is a goodness of fit statistic and is used in the construction of the “Deviance Information Criterion” or DIC (Spiegelhalter et al. (2014)), which is a relative measure of model comparison. The DIC of the model can be accessed by typing\n\u0026gt; basic.mod$BUGSoutput$DIC\r[1] 282\r\rDiagnostics\rMore diagnostics are available when we convert the model output into an MCMC object using the command\n\u0026gt; basic.mod.mcmc=as.mcmc(basic.mod)\rDifferent packages are available to perform diagnostic checks for Bayesian models. Here, I install and load the mcmcplots package (Curtis (2015)) to obtain graphical diagnostics and results.\n\u0026gt; install.packages(\u0026quot;mcmcplots\u0026quot;)\r\u0026gt; library(mcmcplots)\rFor example, density and trace plots can be obtained by typing\n\u0026gt; denplot(basic.mod.mcmc, parms = c(\u0026quot;beta0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;beta1\u0026quot;))\r\u0026gt; traplot(basic.mod.mcmc, parms = c(\u0026quot;beta0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;beta1\u0026quot;))\rBoth types of graphs suggest that there are not issues in the convergence of the algorithm (smooth normal densities and hairy caterpillar graphs for both MCMC chains).\n\r\rConclusions\rThis tutorial was simply a brief introduction on how simple linear regression models can be fitted using the Bayesian software JAGS via the R2jags package. Although this may seem a complex procedure compared with simply fitting a linear model under the frequentist framework, however, the real advantages of Bayesian methods become evident when the complexity of the analysis is increased (which is often the case in real applications). Indeed, the flexibility in Bayesian modelling allows to account for increasingly complex models in a relatively easy way. In addition, Bayesian methods are ideal when the interest is in taking into account the potential impact that different sources of uncertainty may have on the final results, as they allow the natural propagation of uncertainty throughout each quantity in the model.\n\rReferences\rCurtis, SM. 2015. “Mcmcplots: Create Plots from Mcmc Output.” R Package Version 0.4 2.\n\rGelman, Andrew. 2013.

To improve the quality (and harmonize the generation process) of such evidence, many HTA agencies have established methodological guidelines describing the normative framework inspiring their decision-making process. The information requirements that economic evaluation analyses for HTA must satisfy typically involve the use of complex quantitative syntheses of multiple available datasets, handling mixtures of aggregate and patient-level information, and the use of sophisticated statistical models for the analysis of non-Normal data (e.g. time-to-event, quality of life and costs). Much of the recent methodological research in economic evaluation for healthcare has developed in response to these needs, in terms of sound statistical decision-theoretic foundations, and is increasingly being formulated within a Bayesian paradigm. The rationale for this preference lies in the fact that by taking a probabilistic approach, based on decision rules and available information, a Bayesian economic evaluation study can explicitly account for relevant sources of uncertainty in the decision process and produce information to identify an optimal course of actions.  Moreover, the Bayesian approach naturally allows the incorporation of an element of judgement or evidence from different sources (e.g.~expert opinion or multiple studies) into the analysis. This is particularly important when, as often occurs in economic evaluation for HTA, the evidence base is sparse and requires some inevitable mathematical modelling to bridge the gaps in the available data. The availability of free and open source software in the last two decades has greatly reduced the computational costs and facilitated the application of Bayesian methods and has the potential to improve the work of modellers and regulators alike, thus advancing the fields of economic evaluation of health care interventions. This chapter provides an overview of the areas where Bayesian methods have contributed to the address the methodological needs that stem from the normative framework adopted by a number of HTA agencies.","tags":["Economic Evaluations","Bayesian Statistics"],"title":"Bayesian Statistical Economic Evaluation Methods for Health Technology Assessment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Gabrio","R Hunter","AJ Mason","G Baio"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"59de577875bb81ae76f7296d27d711a0","permalink":"/publication/gabrio2019d/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gabrio2019d/","section":"publication","summary":"Failure to account for baseline utilities/costs imbalance between treatment groups in cost-effectiveness analyses can result in biased estimates and mislead the decision making process.

Should the mean of the complete cases or the available cases baseline utilities/costs be used in generating the adjusted estimates? To our knowledge there is no current guideline about this choice in the literature, with standard software implementations often implicitly selecting one of the methods. We use two trials as motivating examples to show that the two approaches can lead to substantially different conclusions for healthcare decision making and that standard approaches which automatically resort to complete case analysis are potentially dangerous and biased.

A critical problem in these analyses is that both effectiveness and cost data typically present some complexity (eg, nonnormality, spikes, and missingness) that should be addressed using appropriate methods. However, in routine analyses, standardised approaches are typically used, possibly leading to biassed inferences. We present a general Bayesian framework that can handle the complexity. We show the benefits of using our approach with a motivating example, the MenSS trial, for which there are spikes at one in the effectiveness and missingness in both outcomes. We contrast a set of increasingly complex models and perform sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the conclusions to a range of plausible missingness assumptions. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach with a second example, the PBS trial, and extend the framework to accommodate the characteristics of the data in this study.

A range of parametric distributions can be specified when modelling the typical outcomes in an trial-based economic evaluations, namely the effectiveness and cost variabels, while simultaneously incorporating different assumptions about the missingness mechanism, which allows to easily perform sensitvity analysis to a range of alternative missing data assumptions according to the modelling choices selected by the user.\nmissingHE also provides functions, taken and adapted from other R packages, to assess the results of each type of model, including summaries of the posterior distributions of each model parameter, range and imputations of the missing values, different types of model diagnostics to assess convergence of the algorithm, posterior predictive checks, model assessment measures based on the fit to the observed data, and a general summary of the economic evaluations, including the results from probabilistic sensitivity analyses which are automatically performed within a Bayesian modelling framework.\nFor example, the function plot, when applied to the output of a model fitted using missingHE, produces graphs which compare the observed and imputed values for both cost and benefit measures in each treatment group to detect possible concerns about the plausibility of the imputations.\nMore information, including new updates, about \u0026lsquo;missingHE\u0026rsquo; can be found at this dedicated page\n","date":1517788800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517788800,"objectID":"28eb798e628125aa2f3089fd4e6e3707","permalink":"/project/missinghe/","publishdate":"2018-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/missinghe/","section":"project","summary":"An R package to handle missingness in health economic evaluations","tags":["Missing Data","Bayesian Modelling"],"title":"missingHE","type":"project"},{"authors":["A Gabrio","AJ Mason","G Baio"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496275200,"objectID":"bbef5e786cc53704ee1f92102539d5e4","permalink":"/publication/gabrio2017/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gabrio2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) alongside randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are increasingly designed to collect resource use and preference-based health status data for the purpose of healthcare technology assessment.

The purpose of this review is to critically appraise the current literature in within-trial CEAs with respect to the quality of the information reported and the methods used to deal with missingness for both effectiveness and costs. The review complements previous work, covering 2003-2009 (88 articles) with a new systematic review, covering 2009-2015 (81 articles) and focuses on two~perspectives.\nFirst, we provide guidelines on how the information about missingness and related methods should be presented to improve the reporting and handling of missing data. We propose to address this issue by means of a quality evaluation scheme, providing a structured approach that can be used to guide the collection of information, formulation of the assumptions, choice of methods, and considerations of possible limitations for the given missingness problem. Second, we review the description of the missing data, the statistical methods used to deal with them and the quality of the judgement underpinning the choice of these methods.\nQuality Evaluation Scheme In order to judge whether missing data in CEAs have been adequately handled, we assembled guidelines from previous review articles on how information relating to the missing data should be reported. In particular, we defined three broad components of the analysis that are related to the description of the missingness problem (Description), details of the methods used to address it (Methods) and a discussion on the uncertainty in the conclusions resulting from the missingness (Limitations). For each component, information that is considered to be vital for transparency is listed under key considerations, while other details that could usefully be provided as supplementary material are suggested under optimal considerations.\nUsing the list of key considerations, we determine whether null (all key considerations absent), partial (one or more key considerations absent) or full (all key considerations present) information has been provided for each component. The set of key considerations is defined to ensure a full assessment of the impact that missingness may have on the final conclusions of the analysis with respect to all three components. However, providing a certain level of information on one component (e.g.~full information on Description) typically has a different impact on the results with respect to providing the same level of information on another component (e.g.~full information on Limitations). Based on this, we suggest computing a numerical score that weights each component by the impact that it may have on the final results to summarise the overall information provided on missingness.\nDifferent score values are calculated based on whether full, partial or null information content is provided in each component and by weighting the three components in a ratio of 3:2:1 (Description: Method: Limitations). This weighting scheme has been chosen according to the impact that each component is likely to have on the final conclusions based on assumptions that we deemed to be~reasonable. Specifically, the Limitations component typically has the least importance among the three because of its limited impact on the conclusions. In the same way, the Description component has potentially a higher impact on the results than the Method component as it generally drives the choice for the initial assumptions about the missingness.\nFinally, the relevance of the scores in terms of decision analysis is mainly associated with a qualitative assessment of the articles. Therefore, we suggest converting the scores into ordered grades (A-E) to evaluate the studies based on the overall information reported on the handling of the missing data. Studies that are graded in the top categories should be associated with a higher degree of confidence in their results, whereas more caution should be given in the consideration of results coming from studies that are graded in the bottom categories. When qualitatively assessing the articles, the different grading assigned to each of them could be an indication of a lack in the robustness of the conclusions provided due to missingness uncertainty. With respect to the quality assessment of the studies, the aggregation of the quality scores on the components of the analysis (Description, Method and Limitations) into ordered grades could lead to some loss of information compared with the direct use of the quality scores on each component. However, merging the scores into a fewer number of categories ensures a relatively easy comparison of the quality of the information provided across the three analysis components and provides a useful indication about the different degree of confidence to assign to the results obtained by each study.\nThe Figure below shows a visual representation of the grade (and score) assignment in the quality evaluation scheme. Although the importance between the different components is subjective, the chosen structure represents a reasonable and relatively straightforward assessment scheme.\n\rQuality Evaluation Scheme.\r\r\rThe articles reviewed for the two periods are presented and compared by type of analysis performed. First, the base-case methods are considered, i.e.~those used in the main analysis. Second, any alternative methods in these analyses are discussed; when present, these assess the robustness of the results obtained in the main analysis against departures from the initial assumptions on missingness.\nSummary of the findings Our review is based on a sample of recently published studies and should therefore provide a picture of current missing data handling in within-trial CEAs. However, the quality assessment of the articles is based on the information reported in the articles. It is possible that authors had assessed the robustness of their conclusions to the missing data using alternative approaches that were not reported in the published version because of space limitations in journals. In these cases, it is important that on-line appendices and supplementary material are used to report these~alternatives. In our literature review, information about missing data information and methods was available from $4$ and $9$ on-line supplementary materials for the period 2003-2009 and 2009-2015, respectively. Both the larger number of on-line materials and more detailed information reported about missingness handling in the analyses indicate an increased use of this tool in the later period (2009-2015) compared to the first period (2003-2009).\nDescriptive Review \rMissingness methods by outcome and period.\r\r\rFrom the comparison of the base-case methods used for the costs and effects between 2009 and 2015, the Figure above shows a marked reduction in the number of methods not clearly described for the effects, compared to those for the costs. A possible reason for this is that, while clinical effectiveness measures are often collected through self-reported questionnaires, which are naturally prone to missingness, cost measures rely more on clinical patient files which may ensure a higher completeness rate. It was not possible to confirm this interpretation in the reviewed studies due to the high proportions of articles not clearly reporting the missing rates in both 2003-2009 and 2009-2015 periods, for effects ($\\approx 45\\%$ and $\\approx 38\\%$) and costs ( $\\approx 50\\%$ and $\\approx 62\\%$). In addition, clinical outcomes are almost invariably the main objective of RCTs and are usually subject to more advanced and standardised analyses. Arguably, costs are often considered as an add-on to the standard trial: for instance, sample size calculations are almost always performed with the effectiveness measure as the only outcome of interest. Consequently, missing data methods are less frequently well thought through for the analysis of the costs. However, this situation is likely to change as cost data from different perspectives (e.g. caregivers, patients, society, etc.) are being increasingly used in trials, leading to the more frequent adoption of self-report cost data which may start to exhibit similar missingness characteristics to effect data.\nThe review identified only a few articles using more than one alternative method. In addition, these analyses are typically conducted without any clear justification about their underlying missing data assumptions and may therefore not provide a concrete assessment of the impact of missingness uncertainty. This situation indicates a gap in the literature associated with an under-implementation of sensitivity analysis, which may significantly affect the whole decision-making process outcome, under the perspective of a body who is responsible for providing recommendations about the implementation of alternative interventions for health care matters.\nLimiting the assessment of missingness assumptions to a single case is unlikely to provide a reliable picture of the underlying mechanism. This, in turn, may have a significant impact on the CEA and mislead its conclusions, suggesting the implementation of non-cost-effective treatments. Robustness analyses assess the sensitivity of the results to alternative missing data methods but do not justify the choice of these methods and their underlying assumptions about missingness which may therefore be inappropriate in the specific context analysed. By contrast, sensitivity analyses, which rely on external information to explore plausible alternative methods and missingness assumptions, represent an important and more appropriate tool to provide realistic assessments of the impact of missing data uncertainty on the final conclusions.\nQuality assessment Generally speaking, most of the reviewed papers achieved an unsatisfactory quality score under the Quality Evaluation Scheme. Indeed, the benchmark area on the top-right corner of the graphs is barely reached by less than $7\\%$ of the articles, both for cost and effect data.\nOverall, the proportions of the studies associated with the lowest category (E) prevails in the majority of the years, with a similar pattern over time between missing costs and effects. All the articles that are associated with the top category (A) belong to the period 2013-2015, with the highest proportions of articles falling in this category being observed in 2015 for both outcomes. The opportunity of reaching such a target might be precluded by the choice of the method adopted, which may not be able to support less restrictive assumptions about missingness, even when this would be desirable. As a result, when simple methods cannot be fully justified it is necessary to replace them with more flexible ones that can relax assumptions and incorporate more alternatives. In settings such as those involving MNAR, sensitivity analysis might represent the only possible approach to account for the uncertainty due to the missingness in a principled way. However, due to the lack of studies either performing a sensitivity analysis or providing high quality scores on the assumptions, missingness is not adequately addressed in most studies. This could have the serious consequence of imposing too restrictive assumptions about missingness and affect the outcome of decision making.\nConclusions Our review shows, over time, a significant change from more to less restrictive methods in terms of the assumptions on the missingness mechanism. This is an encouraging movement towards a more suitable and careful missing data analysis. The results from the disaggregated analysis by year of publication in the later period (2009-2015) indicates the rise of a better and more transparent approach to handle missingness in the latest years of the review, especially in 2015. In particular, compared to the previous years, the articles reviewed from 2015 are associated with a higher proportion of MI methods used in the base-case analysis, a substantial increase in the number of robustness methods implemented, and a better quality score assignment.\nNevertheless, improvements are still needed as, overall, only a small number of articles provide transparent information about the missing data and almost no study performs a sensitivity~analysis. These failings are probably due to the fact that the implications of using methods that do not handle missingness in a principled way are not well-known among practitioners. In addition, the choice of the missing data methods may also be guided by their ease of implementation in standard software packages rather than methodological reasons. This is a potentially serious issue for bodies such as the NICE who use these evaluations in their decision making, thus possibly leading to incorrect policy decisions about the cost-effectiveness of new treatment options.\nThe Quality Evaluation Scheme represents a valuable tool to improve missing data handling. By carefully thinking about each component in the analysis we are forced to explicitly consider all the assumptions we make about missingness and assess the impact of their variation on final conclusions. The main advantage is a more comparable formalisation of the uncertainty as well as a better indication of possible issues in assessing the cost-effectiveness of new treatments.\n","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496275200,"objectID":"264b6a73ec81e06fc20279d323edf442","permalink":"/project/missing-data-review/","publishdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/missing-data-review/","section":"project","summary":"With [Alexina Mason](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/mason.alexina) and [Gianluca Baio](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/gianlucabaio)","tags":["Missing Data"],"title":"Missingness Methods in trial-based CEA","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1473346800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1473346800,"objectID":"a177d4c811e51520cedd357bee093b9f","permalink":"/talk/euhea2016/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/euhea2016/","section":"talk","summary":"Contributed presentation","tags":["Economic Evaluations","Missing Data"],"title":"Handling Missing Data in Within-Trial Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: a Review with Future Recommendations","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":["rubric"],"content":"\rA general problem associated with the implementatio of Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) methods is that information in some available data is ignored by focussing only on the complete cases (Schafer and Graham (2002)). This has provided room to extend these methods to make a more efficient use of the available information through the incorporation of an “augmentation” term, which lead to the development of the so called Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW) methods. These approaches extend IPW methods by creating predictions from a model to recove the information in the incomplete units and applying IPW to the residuals from the model (Little and Rubin (2019)).\nConsidering the IPW Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE)\n\\[\r\\sum_{i=1}^{n_r} = w_i(\\hat{\\alpha})D_i(x_i,\\beta)(y_i-g(x_i,\\beta))=0,\r\\]\nwhere \\(w_i(\\hat{\\alpha})=\\frac{1}{p(x_i,z_i \\mid \\hat{\\alpha})}\\), with \\(p(x_i,z_i \\mid \\hat{\\alpha})\\) an estimate of the probability of being a complete unit estimated for example using logistic regressions of the missingness indicator \\(m_i\\) on the vectors of the covariate and auxiliary variables \\(x_i\\) and \\(z_i\\), respectively. A problem of this IPW estimator is that it has poor small sample properties when the propensity score gets close to zero or one for some observations, which will lead to high variance in the estimator. AIPW methods can provide estimators of \\(\\beta\\) which are more efficient than their nonaugmented IPW versions. In general, AIPW estimating functions provide a method for constructing estimators of \\(\\beta\\) based on two terms:\nThe usual IPW term \\(p(x_i,z_i \\mid \\hat{\\alpha})\\)\n\rAn augmentation term \\(g^\\star(x_i,\\beta)\\)\n\r\rThe basis for the first term is a complete data unbiased estimating function for \\(\\beta\\), whereas the basis for the second term is some function of the observed data chosen so it has conditional mean of zero given the complete data (Molenberghs et al. (2014)).\nDoubly Robust Estimators\rAn important class of AIPW methods is known as doubly robust estimators, which have desirable robustness properties (Robins, Rotnitzky, and Laan (2000),Robins and Rotnitzky (2001)). The key feature of these estimators is that they relax the assumption that the model of the missingness probabilities is correctly specified, although requiring additional assumptions on the model for \\(y_i \\mid x_i\\). For example, doubly robust estimators for a population mean parameter \\(\\mu\\) could be obtained as follows:\nFit a logistic regression model for the probability of observing \\(y_i\\) as a function of \\(x_i\\) and \\(z_i\\) to derive the individual weights \\(w_i(\\hat{\\alpha})\\).\n\rFit a generalized linear model for the outcome of responders in function of \\(x_i\\) using weights \\(w_i(\\hat{\\alpha})\\) and let \\(g^\\star(x_i,\\beta)\\) denote the fitted values for subject \\(i\\).\n\rTake the sample average of the fitted values \\(g^\\star(x_i,\\beta)\\) of both respondents and nonrespondents as an estimate of the population mean \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\)\n\r\rDoubly robust estimators require the specification of two models: one for the missingness probability and another for the distribution of the incomplete data. When the augmentation term \\(g^\\star(x_i,\\beta)\\) is selected and modelled correctly according to the distribution of the complete data, the resulting estimator of \\(\\beta\\) is consistent even if the model of missingness is misspecified. On the other hand, if the model of missingness is correctly specified, the augmentation term no longer needs to be correctly specified to yield consistent estimators of \\(\\beta\\) (Scharfstein, Daniels, and Robins (2003),Bang and Robins (2005)). Doubly robust estimators therefore allow to obtain an unbiased estimating function for \\(\\beta\\) if either the model for the incomplete data or the model for the missingness mechanism has been correctly specified.\n\rExample\rSuppose the full data consists of a single outcome variable \\(y\\) and an additional variable \\(z\\) and that the objective is to estimate the population outcome mean \\(\\mu=\\text{E}[y]\\). When \\(y\\) is partially observed (while \\(Z\\) is always fully observed), individuals may fall into one of two missingness patterns \\(r=(r_{y},r_{z})\\), namely \\(r=(1,1)\\) if both variables are observed or \\(r=(1,0)\\) if \\(y\\) is missing. Let \\(c=1\\) if \\(r=(1,1)\\) and \\(c=0\\) otherwise, so that the observed data can be summarised as \\((c,cy,z)\\). Assuming that missingness only depends on \\(z\\), that is\n\\[\rp(c=1 \\mid y,z)=p(c=1 \\mid z)=\\pi(z),\r\\]\nthen the missing data mechanism is Missing At Random (MAR). Under these conditions, consider the consistent IPW complete case estimating equation\n\\[\r\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{c_i}{\\pi(z_i \\mid \\hat{\\alpha})}(y_i-\\mu)=0,\r\\]\nwhich can be used to weight the contribution of each complete case by the inverse of \\(\\pi(z_i \\mid \\hat{\\alpha})\\), typically estimated via logistic regressions. A general problem of this type of estimators is that they discard all the available data among the non-completers and are therefore inefficient. However, it is possible to augment the simple IPW complete case estimating equation to improve efficiency. The optimal estimator for \\(\\mu\\) within this class is the solution to the estimating equation\n\\[\r\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{c_i}{\\pi(z_i \\mid \\hat{\\alpha})}(y_i-\\mu) - \\frac{c_i-\\pi(z_i \\mid \\hat{\\alpha})}{\\pi(z_i \\mid \\hat{\\alpha})}\\text{E}[(y_i-\\mu)\\mid z_i] \\right),\r\\]\nwhich leads to the estimator\n\\[\r\\mu_{aipw}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{c_iy_i}{\\pi(z_i\\mid \\hat{\\alpha})} - \\frac{c_i - \\pi(z_i\\mid \\hat{\\alpha})}{\\pi(z_i\\mid \\hat{\\alpha})} \\text{E}[y_i \\mid z_i] \\right).\r\\]\nThe conditional expectation \\(\\text{E}[y_i \\mid z_i]\\) is not known and must be estimated from the data. Under a Missing At Random (MAR) assumption we have that \\(\\text{E}[y \\mid z]=\\text{E}[y \\mid z, c=1]\\), that is the conditional expecation of \\(y\\) given \\(z\\) is the same as that among the completers. Thus, we can specify a model \\(m(z,\\xi)\\) for \\(\\text{E}[y \\mid z]\\), indexed by the parameter \\(\\xi\\), that can be estimated from the completers. If \\(y\\) is continuous, a simple choice is to estimate \\(\\hat{\\xi}\\) by OLS from the completers. The AIPW estimator for \\(\\mu\\) then becomes\n\\[\r\\mu_{aipw}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{c_iy_i}{\\pi(z_i\\mid \\hat{\\alpha})} - \\frac{c_i - \\pi(z_i\\mid \\hat{\\alpha})}{\\pi(z_i\\mid \\hat{\\alpha})} m(z_i\\mid \\hat{\\xi}) \\right).\r\\]\nIt can be shown that this estimator is more efficient that the simple IPW complete case estimator for \\(\\mu\\) and that it has a double robustness property. This ensures that \\(\\mu_{aipw}\\) is a consitent estimator of \\(\\mu\\) if either\n\rthe model \\(\\pi(z\\mid\\alpha)\\) is correctly specified, or\n\rthe model \\(m(z\\mid \\xi)\\) is correctly specified.\n\r\rTo see a derivation of the double robustness property I put here a link to some nice paper.\n\rConlcusions\rAs all weighting methods, such as IPW, AIPW methods are semiparametric methods that aim to achieve robustness and good performance over more general classes of population distributions. However, semiparametric estimators can be less efficient and less powerful than Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian estimators under a well specified parametric model. With missing data, Rubin (1976) results show that likelihood-based methods perform uniformly well over any Missing At Random (MAR) missingness distribution, and the user does not need to specify that distribution. However, semiparametric methods that relax assumptions about the data must in turn assume a specific form for the distribution of missingness. It has been argued that, for these semiparametric methods to gain a substantial advantage over well-specified likelihood methods, the parametric model has to be grossly misspecified (Meng (2000)).\n\rReferences\rBang, Heejung, and James M Robins. 2005. “Doubly Robust Estimation in Missing Data and Causal Inference Models.” Biometrics 61 (4): 962–73.\n\rLittle, Roderick JA, and Donald B Rubin. 2019.

An alternative approach that can be used to conduct univariate analyses in known as Available Case Analysis (ACA), which uses all the available cases, separately for each variable under examination, to estimate the quantities of interest.\nThe main drawback of ACA is that the sample used to perform the analysis varies from variable to variable according to the patterns of missing data, which generates problems of comparability across variables if the missingness mechanism is not missing completely at random (MCAR), i.e. the missing data probabilities depend on the variables under study. While estimates of means and variances can be easily computed, measures of covariation need to be adjusted. In particular, for estimating sample covariances, this approach is known as pairwise deletion or pairwise inclusion\nPairwise measures of covariation\rOne possible approach to estimate pairwise measures of covariation for \\(y_j\\) and \\(y_k\\) is to use only those units \\(i=1,\\ldots,n_{ac}\\) for which both variables are observed (Little and Rubin (2019)). For example, one can compute pairwise sample covariances as:\n\\[\rs^{ac}_{jk} = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in I_{ac}}(y_{ij}-\\bar{y}_{j}^{ac})(y_{ik}-\\bar{y}_{k}^{ac})}{(n_{ac}-1)},\r\\]\nwhere \\(I_{ac}\\) is the set of \\(n_{ac}\\) with both \\(y_j\\) and \\(y_k\\) observed, while the sample means \\(\\bar{y}^{ac}_{j}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}^{ac}_{k}\\) are calculated over this set of units. We can also estimate the sample correlation\n\\[\rr^{\\star}_{jk} = \\frac{s^{ac}_{jk}}{\\sqrt{s^2_{j}s^{2}_{k}}},\r\\]\nwhere \\(s^2_{j}\\) and \\(s^2_{k}\\) are the sample variances computed over the sets of observed units \\(I_{j}\\) and \\(I_{k}\\), respectively. A problem of this type of correlation estimate is that it can lie outside the range \\((-1,1)\\), which is typically addressed by computing pairwise correlations (Wilks (1932)), where variances are estimated from the set of units with both variables observed \\(I_{jk}\\), i.e. \\[\rr^{ac}_{jk} = \\frac{s^{ac}_{jk}}{\\sqrt{s^{2,ac}_{j}s^{2,ac}_{k}}}.\r\\]\nIn addition, we could also replace the sample means \\(\\bar{y}^{ac}_{j}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}^{ac}_{k}\\), evaluated on the common set of units \\(I_{jk}\\), with \\(\\bar{y}_{j}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}_{k}\\), which are evaluated on the sets of units \\(I_{j}\\) and \\(I_{k}\\), respectively. This leads to the following estimates for the sample covariances (Matthai (1951)):\n\\[\rs^{\\star}_{jk} = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in I_{ac}}(y_{ij}-\\bar{y}_{j})(y_{ik}-\\bar{y}_{k})}{(n_{ac}-1)},\r\\]\nPairwise AC estimates aim at recovering information from partially-observed units that are lost by CCA. However, when considered together, the estimates suffer from inconsistencies that undermine the validity of these methods. For example, pairwise correlation matrices may be not positive definite. Because parameters are estimated from different sets of units, different approaches can be used to obtain estimate of the measures of uncertainty (Schafer and Graham (2002)).\n\rConclusions\rAC estimates allow to make use of all the available evidence in the data and may be more efficient that CCA when the missingness mechanism is MCAR and correlations are modest (Kim and Curry (1977)).

The posterior distribution for a model with ignorable missingness is\n\\[\rp(\\theta \\mid Y_0, M) \\equiv p(\\theta \\mid Y_0) \\propto p(\\theta)f(Y_0 \\mid \\theta),\r\\]\nwhere \\(p(\\theta)\\) is the prior and \\(f(Y_0 \\mid \\theta)\\) is the density of the observed data \\(Y_0\\). Simulation from the posterior without iteration can be accomplished if the likelihood can be factored into complete data components, while for general patterns of missing data, Bayesian simulation requires iteration.\nData Augmentation\rData Augmentation(Tanner and Wong (1987)), or DA, is an iterative method of simulating the posteiror distribution of \\(\\theta\\) that combines features of the Expecation Maximisation(EM) algorithm and Multiple Imputation(MI). Starting with an initial draw \\(\\theta_0\\) from an approximation to the posterior, then given the value \\(\\theta_t\\) at iteration \\(t\\):\nDraw \\(Y_{1,t+1}\\) with density \\(p(Y_1 \\mid Y_0, \\theta_t)\\) (I step).\n\rDraw \\(\\theta_{t+1}\\) with density \\(p(\\theta \\mid Y_0, Y_{1,t+1})\\) (P step).\n\r\rThe procedure is motivated by the fact that the distributions in these two steps are often much easier to draw from than either of the posteriors \\(p(Y_1 \\mid Y_0)\\) and \\(p(\\theta \\mid Y_0)\\), or the joint posterior \\(p(\\theta, Y_1 \\mid Y_0)\\). The procedure can be shown to eventually yield a draw from the joint posterior of \\(Y_1\\) and \\(\\theta\\) given \\(Y_0\\), in the sense that as \\(t\\) tends to infinity this sequence converges to a draw from the joint distribution.\nBivariate Normal Data Example\rSuppose having a sample \\(y_i=(y_{1i},y_{2i})\\) from a Bivariate Normal distribution for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) units, with mean vector \\(\\mu=(\\mu_1,\\mu_2)\\) and \\(2\\times2\\) covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\). Assume that one group of units has \\(Y_1\\) observed and \\(Y_2\\) missing, while a second group of units has both variables observed and a third group of units has \\(Y_1\\) missing and \\(Y_2\\) observed. Under DA methods, each iteration \\(t\\) consists of an I step and a P step. In the first, missing data are replaced with draws from its conditional distribution given the observed data and current values of the parameters (rather then its conditional mean as in the EM algorithm). Because units are conditionally independent given the parameters, each missing \\(y_{2i}\\) is drawn independently as\n\\[\ry_{2i,t+1} \\sim N\\left(\\beta_{20t} + \\beta_{21t}y_{1i}, \\sigma^2_{2t} \\right),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_{20t},\\beta_{21t}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{2t}\\) are the \\(t\\)-th iterates of the regression parameters of \\(Y_2\\) on \\(Y_1\\). Analogously, each missing \\(y_{1i}\\) is drawn independently as\n\\[\ry_{1i,t+1} \\sim N\\left(\\beta_{10t} + \\beta_{11t}y_{2i}, \\sigma^2_{1t} \\right),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_{10t},\\beta_{11t}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_{1t}\\) are the \\(t\\)-th iterates of the regression parameters of \\(Y_1\\) on \\(Y_2\\). In the second step, these drawn values are treated as if they were the observed values and one draw of the bivariate Normal parameters is made from the complete data posterior. In the limit, the draws are from the joint posterior of the missing values and the parameters. Thus, a run of DA generates both a draw from the posterior predictive distribution of \\(Y_1\\) and a draw from the posterior of \\(\\theta\\), and the procedure can be run \\(D\\) times to obtain \\(D\\) iid draws from the joint posterior of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(Y_1\\). Unlike the EM, estimates of the sampling covariance matrix from the filled-in data can be computed without any corrections to the estimated variances because draws from the posterior predictive distribution of the missing values are imputed in the I step of DA, rather than the conditional means as in the E step of EM. The loss of efficiency from imputing draws is limited when the posterior mean from DA is computed over many draws from the posterior.\n\r\rThe Gibbs’ Sampler\rThe Gibbs’s sampler is an iterative simulation method that is designed to yield draws from the joint posterior distribution in the case of a general pattern of missingness and provides a Bayesian analogous to the Expectation Conditonal Maximisation (ECM) algorithm for ML estimation. The Gibbs’ sampler eventually generates a draw from the distribution \\(p(x_1,\\ldots,x_J)\\) of a set of \\(J\\) random variables \\(X_1,\\ldots,X_J\\) in settings where draws from the joint distribution are hard to compute but draws from the conditional distributions \\(p(x_j \\mid x_1,\\ldots,x_{j-1},x_{j+1},\\ldots, x_J)\\) are relatively easy to compute. Initial values \\(x_{10},\\ldots,x_{J0}\\) are chosen in some way and then, given current values of \\(x_{1t},\\ldots,x_{Jt}\\) at iteration \\(t\\), new values are found by drawing from the following sequence of conditional distributions:\n\\[\rx_{1t+1} \\sim p\\left(x_1 \\mid x_{2t},\\ldots,x_{Jt} \\right),\r\\]\n\\[\rx_{2t+1} \\sim p\\left(x_2 \\mid x_{1t+1},\\ldots,x_{Jt} \\right),\r\\]\nup to\n\\[\rx_{Jt+1} \\sim p\\left(x_J \\mid x_{2t+1},\\ldots,x_{J-1t+1} \\right).\r\\]\nIt can be shown that, under general conditions, the sequence of \\(J\\) iterates converges to a draw from the joint posterior of the variables. When \\(J=2\\), the Gibbs’ sampler is the same as DA if \\(x_1=Y_1\\) and \\(x_2=\\theta\\) and the distributions condition on \\(Y_0\\). We can then obtain a draw from the joint posterior of \\(Y_1,\\theta \\mid Y_0\\) by applying the Gibbs’ sampler, where at iteration \\(t\\) for the \\(d\\)-th imputed data set:\n\\[\rY^d_{1t+1} \\sim p\\left(Y_1 \\mid Y_0, \\theta^d_{t}\\right) \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; \\theta^d_{t+1} \\sim p\\left(\\theta \\mid Y^d_{1t+1}, Y_0\\right),\r\\]\nsuch that one run of the sampler converges to a draw from the posterior predictive distribution of \\(Y_1\\) and a draw from the posterior of \\(\\theta\\). The sampler can be run independently \\(D\\) times to generate \\(D\\) iid draws from the approximate joint posterior of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(Y_1\\). The values of \\(Y_1\\) are multiple imputations of the missing values, drawn from their posterior predictive distribution.\n\rAssessing Convergence\rAssessing convergence of the sequence of draws to the target distribution is more difficult than assessing convergence of an EM-type algorithm because there is no single target quantity to monitor like the maximum value of the likelihood. Methods have been proposed to assess convergence of a single sequence (Geyer (1992)), but a more reliable approach is to simulate \\(D\u0026gt;1\\) sequences with starting values dispersed throughout the parameter space, and the convergence of all quantities of interest can then be monitored by comparing variation between and within simulated sequences, until the “within” variation roughly equals the “between” variation. The idea is that when the distribution of each simulated sequence is close enough to the distribution of all the sequences mixed together, they can all be approximating the target distribution. Gelman and Rubin (1992) developed an explicit monitoring statistic based on the following idea. For each scalar estimand \\(\\psi\\), label the draws from \\(D\\) parallel sequences as \\(\\psi^d_{t}\\), for \\(t=1,\\ldots,T\\) iterations and \\(d=1,\\ldots,D\\) sequences, and compute the between \\(B\\) and within \\(\\bar{V}\\) sequence variances as:\n\\[\rB=\\frac{T}{D-1}\\sum_{d=1}^D(\\bar{\\psi}_{d.} - \\bar{\\psi}_{..})^2, \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; \\bar{V}=\\frac{1}{D}\\sum_{d=1}^D s^2_{d},\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{\\psi}_{d.}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^T \\psi_{dt}\\), \\(\\bar{\\psi}_{..}=\\frac{1}{D}\\sum_{d=1}^D \\bar{\\psi}_{d}\\), and \\(s^2_{d}=\\frac{1}{T-1}\\sum_{t=1}^T(\\psi_{dt} - \\bar{\\psi}_{d.})^2\\). We can then estimate the marginal posterior variance of the estimand as\n\\[\r\\widehat{Var}(\\psi \\mid Y_0) = \\frac{T-1}{T}\\hat{V} + \\frac{1}{T} B,\r\\]\nwhich will overestimate the marginal posterior variance assuming the starting distribution is appropriately over-dispersed but is unbiased under stationarity (starting distribution equals the target distribution). For any finte \\(T\\), the within variance \\(\\hat{V}\\) will underestimate the marginal variance because individual sequences have not had time to range over all the target distribution and should have smaller variance then B. In the limit as \\(T \\rightarrow \\infty\\) the expecation of \\(\\hat{V}\\) approaches the marginal variance. These facts suggest monitoring convergence by estimating the factor by which the scale of the current distribution for \\(\\psi\\) might be reduced if the simulations were continued. This is the potential scale reduction factor and is estimated by\n\\[\r\\sqrt{\\hat{R}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{Var}(\\psi \\mid Y_0)}{\\hat{V}}},\r\\]\nwhich declines to 1 as \\(T \\rightarrow \\infty\\). When this quantity is high, there is evidence to proceed the simulations further to improve our inference about the target distribution.\n\rOther Simulation Methods\rWhen draws from the sequence of conditional distributions forming the Gibbs’ sampler are not easy to obtain, other simulation approaches are needed. Among these there are the Sequential Imputation (Kong, Liu, and Wong (1994)), Sampling Imprtance Resampling (Gelfand and Smith (1990)), Rejection Sampling (Von Neumann and others (1951)). One of these alternatives are the Metropolis-Hastings (Metropolis et al. (1953)) algorithms, of which the Gibbs’ sampler is a particular case, which constitute the so-called Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms as the sequence of iterates forms a Markov Chain (Gelman et al. (2013)).\n\rReferences\rGelfand, Alan E, and Adrian FM Smith. 1990. “Sampling-Based Approaches to Calculating Marginal Densities.” Journal of the American Statistical Association 85 (410): 398–409.\n\rGelman, Andrew, John B Carlin, Hal S Stern, David B Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald B Rubin. 2013.

Traditionally, relative effectiveness data are derived from randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs), while healthcare resource utilisation, costs and preference-based quality of life data may come from the same study that estimated the clinical effectiveness or not. A number of HTA agencies have developed their own methodological guidelines to support the generation of the evidence required to inform their decisions. In this context, the primary role of economic evaluation for HTA is not the estimation of the quantities of interest (e.g. the computation of point or interval estimation, or hypothesis testing), but to aid decision making. The implication of this is that the standard frequentist analyses that rely on power calculations and $P$-values to estimate statistical and clinical significance, typically used in RCTs, are not well-suited for addressing these HTA requirements.\nIt has been argued that, to be consistent with its intended role in HTA, economic evaluation should embrace a decision-theoretic paradigm and develop ideally within a Bayesian statistical framework to inform two decisions\n whether the treatments under evaluation are cost-effective given the available evidence and whether the level of uncertainty surrounding the decision is acceptable (i.e. the potential benefits are worth the costs of making the wrong decision).\n  This corresponds to quantify the impact of the uncertainty in the evidence on the entire decision-making process (e.g. to what extent the uncertainty in the estimation of the effectiveness of a new intervention affects the decision about whether it is paid for by the public provider).\nBayesian methods in HTA There are several reasons that make the use of Bayesian methods in economic evaluations particularly appealing. First, Bayesian modelling is naturally embedded in the wider scheme of decision theory; by taking a probabilistic approach, based on decision rules and available information, it is possible to explicitly account for relevant sources of uncertainty in the decision process and obtain an optimal course of action. Second, Bayesian methods allow extreme flexibility in modelling using computational algorithms such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods; this allows to handle in a relatively easy way the generally sophisticated structure of the relationships and complexities that characterise effectiveness, quality of life and cost data. Third, through the use of prior distributions, the Bayesian approach naturally allows the incorporation of evidence from different sources in the analysis (e.g. expert opinion or multiple studies), which may improve the estimation of the quantities of interest; the process is generally referred to as evidence synthesis and finds its most common application in the use of meta-analytic tools. This may be extremely important when, as it often happens, there is only some partial (imperfect) information to identify the model parameters. In this case analysts are required to develop chain-of-evidence models. When required by the limitations in the evidence base, subjective prior distributions can be specified based on the synthesis and elicitation of expert opinion to identify the model, and their impact on the results can be assessed by presenting or combining the results across a range of plausible alternatives. Finally, under a Bayesian approach, it is straightforward to conduct sensitivity analysis to properly account for the impact of uncertainty in all inputs of the decision process; this is a required component in the approval or reimbursement of a new intervention for many decision-making bodies, such as NICE in the UK.\nThe general process of conducting a Bayesian analysis (with a view of using the results of the model to perform an economic evaluation) can be broken down in several steps, which are graphically summarized in the Figure below.\n\rProcess of health economic evaluation.\r\r\rThe starting point is the identification of the decision problem, which defines the objective of the economic evaluation (e.g. the interventions being compared, the target population, the relevant time horizon). In line with the decision problem, a statistical model is constructed to describe the (by necessity, limited) knowledge of the underlying clinical pathways. This implies, for example, the definition of suitable models to describe variability in potentially observed data (e.g. the number of patients recovering from the disease because of a given treatment), as well as the epistemic uncertainty in the population parameters (e.g.~the underlying probability that a random individual in the target population is cured, if given the treatment under study). At this point, all the relevant data are identified, collected and quantitatively sytnthesised to derive the estimates of the input parameters of interest for the model.\nThese parameter estimates (and associated uncertainties) are then fed to the economic model, with the objective of obtaining some relevant summaries indicating the benefits and costs for each intervention under evaluation. Uncertainty analysis represents some sort of detour from the straight path going from the statistical model to the decision analysis: if the output of the statistical model allowed us to know with perfect certainty the true value of the model parameters, then it would be possible to simply run the decision analysis and make the decision. Of course, even if the statistical model were the true representation of the underlying data generating process (which it most certainly is not), because the data may be limited in terms of length of follow up, or sample size, the uncertainty in the value of the model parameters would still remain. This parameter (and structural) uncertainty is propagated throughout the whole process to evaluate its impact on the decision-making. In some cases, although there might be substantial uncertainty in the model inputs, this may not turn out to modify substantially the output of the decision analysis, i.e. the new treatment would be deemed as optimal irrespectively. In other cases, however, even a small amount of uncertainty in the inputs could be associated with very serious consequences. In such circumstances, the decision-maker may conclude that the availbale evidence is not sufficient to decide on which intervention to select and require more information before a decision can be made.\nThe results of the above analysis can be used to inform policy makers about two related decisions:\n whether the new intervention is to be considered (on average) value for money, given the evidence base available at the time of decision, and whether the consequences (in terms of net health loss) of making the wrong decision would warrant further research to reduce this decision uncertaint.\n  While the type and specification of the statistical and economic models vary with the nature of the underlying data (e.g. individual (ILD) level versus aggregated (ALD) data, the decision and uncertainty analyses have a more standardised set up.\nConclusions HTA has been slow to adopt Bayesian methods; this could be due to a reluctance to use prior opinions, unfamiliarity, mathematical complexity, lack of software, or conservatism of the healthcare establishment and, in particular, the regulatory~authorities. However, the use of Bayesian approach has been increasingly advocated as an efficient tool to integrate statistical evidence synthesis and parameter estimation with probabilistic decision analysis in an unified framework for HTA. This enables a transparent evidence-based decision modelling, reflecting the uncertainty and the structural relationships in all the available~data.\nWith respect to trial-based analyses, the flexibility and modularity of the Bayesian modelling structure are well-suited to jointly account for the typical complexities that affect ILD. In addition, prior distributions can be used as convenient means to incorporate external information into the model when the evidence from the data is limited or absent (e.g. for missing values). In the context of evidence synthesis, the Bayesian approach is particularly appealing in that it allows for all the uncertainty and correlation induced by the often heterogeneous nature of the evidence (either ALD only or both ALD and ILD) to be synthesised in a way that can be easily integrated within a decision modelling framework.\nThe availability and spread of Bayesian software among practitioners since the late 1990s, such as OpenBUGS or JAGS, has greatly improved the applicability and reduced the computational costs of these models. Thus, analysts are provided with a powerful framework, which has been termed comprehensive decision modelling, for simultaneously estimating posterior distributions for parameters based on specified prior knowledge and data evidence, and for translating this into the ultimate measures used in the decision analysis to inform cost-effectiveness conclusions.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"971bed50bf7791bf6b8581ec7b3373d8","permalink":"/project/health-economics/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/health-economics/","section":"project","summary":"With [Andrea Manca](https://www.york.ac.uk/che/staff/research/andrea-manca/) and [Gianluca Baio](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/gianlucabaio)","tags":["Health Economics","Bayesian Modelling"],"title":"Bayesian Methods for Health Technology Assessment","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Modelling Framework We propose a unified Bayesian framework that jointly accounts for the typical complexities of the data (e.g. correlation, skewness, spikes at the boundaries and missingness), and that can be implemented in a relatively easy way.\nConsider the usual cross-sectional bivariate outcome formed by the QALYs and total cost variables $(e_{it}, c_{it})$ calculated for the $i-$th person in group $t$ of the trial. To simplify the notation, unless necessary, we suppress the treatment indicator $t$. We specify the joint distribution $p(e_i,c_i)$ as\n\\[ p(e_i,c_i) = p(c_i)p(e_i\\mid c_i) = p(e_i)p(c_i\\mid e_i) \\]\nwhere, for example, $p(e_i)$ is the marginal distribution of the QALYs and $p(c_i\\mid e_i)$ is the conditional distribution of the costs given the QALYs. Note that, although the two factorisations are mathematically equivalent, the choice of which to use has different practical implications. From a statistical point of view, the factorisations require the specifications of different statistical models, e.g. $p(e_i)$ or $p(e_i\\mid c_i)$, which may have different approximation errors. From a clinical point of view, the two versions make different assumptions about the casual relationships between the outcomes, i.e. either $e_i$ determines $c_i$ or vice versa. We describe our analysis under the assumption that the costs are determined by the effectiveness measures and therefore we specify the joint distribution $p(e_i,c_i)$ in terms of a marginal distribution for the QALYs and a conditional distribution for the costs.\nFor each individual we consider a marginal distribution $p(e_i \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta_e)$ indexed by a set of parameters $\\boldsymbol \\theta_e$ comprising a location $\\boldsymbol \\phi_{ie}$ and a set of ancillary parameters $\\boldsymbol\\psi_e$ typically including some measure of marginal variance $\\sigma^2_e$. We can model the location parameter using a generalised linear structure, e.g.\n\\[ g_e(\\phi_{ie})= \\alpha_0 \\,\\,[+ \\ldots] \\]\nwhere $\\alpha_0$ is the intercept and the notation $[+\\ldots]$ indicates that other terms (e.g. quantifying the effect of relevant covariates) may or may not be included. In the absence of covariates or assuming that a centered version $x_i^{\\star} = (x_i - \\bar{x})$ is used, the parameter $\\mu_e = g_e^{-1}(\\alpha_0)$ represents the population average QALYs. For the costs, we consider a conditional model $p(c_i\\mid e_i,\\boldsymbol\\theta_c)$, which explicitly depends on the QALYs, as well as on a set of quantities $\\boldsymbol\\theta_c$, again comprising a location $\\phi_{ic}$ and ancillary parameters $\\boldsymbol \\psi_{c}$. For example, when normal distributions are assumed for both $p(e_i \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta_e)$ and $p(c_i \\mid e_i, \\boldsymbol \\theta_c)$, i.e. bivariate normal on both outcomes, the ancillary parameters $\\boldsymbol\\psi_c$ include a conditional variance $\\tau^2_c$, which can be expressed as a function of the marginal variance $\\sigma^2_c$. More specifically, the conditional variance of $p(c_i \\mid e_i, \\boldsymbol \\theta_c)$ is a function of the marginal effectiveness and cost variances and has the closed form $\\tau^2_c=\\sigma^2_c - \\sigma^2_e \\beta^2$, where $\\beta=\\rho \\frac{\\sigma_c}{\\sigma_e}$ and $\\rho$ is the parameter capturing the correlation between the variables.\nThe location can be modelled as a function of the QALYs as\n\\[ g_c(\\phi_{ic}) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}(e_{i}-\\mu_{e})\\,\\,[+\\ldots] \\]\nHere, $(e_i-\\mu_e)$ is the centered version of the QALYs, while $\\beta_{1}$ quantifies the correlation between costs and QALYs. Assuming other covariates are either also centered or absent, $\\mu_c = g_c^{-1}(\\beta_{0})$ is the estimated population average cost. The Figure below shows a graphical representation of the general modelling framework.\n\rModelling framework.\r\r\rThe QALYs and cost distributions are represented in terms of combined modules, the blue and the red boxes, in which the random quantities are linked through logical relationships. This ensures the full characterisation of the uncertainty for each variable in the model. Notably, this is general enough to be extended to any suitable distributional assumption, as well as to handle covariates in either or both the modules.\nThe proposed framework allows jointly tackling of the different complexities that affect the data in a relatively easy way by means of its modular structure and flexible choice for the distributions of the QALYs and cost variables. Using the MenSS trial as motivating example, we start from the original analysis and expand the model using alternative specifications that progressively account for an increasing number of complexities in the outcomes. We specifically focus on appropriately modelling spikes at the boundary and missingness, as they have substantial implications in terms of inferences and, crucially, cost-effectiveness results.\nExample Three model specifications are considered and applied to QALY data from a RCT case study: 1) Normal marginal for the QALYs and Normal conditional for the costs (which is identical to a Bivariate Normal distribution for the two outcomes); 2) Beta marginal for the QALYs and Gamma conditional for the costs; and 3) Hurdle Model. The following Figure shows the observed QALYs in both treatment groups (indicated with black crosses) as well as summaries of the posterior distributions for the imputed values, obtained from each model. Imputations are distinguished based on whether the corresponding baseline utility value is observed or missing (blue or red lines and dots, respectively) and are summarised in terms of posterior mean and $90\\%$ HPD intervals.\n\rImputed QALYs under alternative model specifications.\r\r\rThere are clear differences in the imputed values and corresponding credible intervals between the three models in both treatment groups. Neither the Bivariate Normal nor the Beta-Gamma models produce imputed values that capture the structural one component in the data. In addition, as to be expected, the Bivariate Normal fails to respect the natural support for the observed QALYs, with many of the imputations exceeding the unit threshold bound. These unrealistic imputed values highlight the inadequacy of the Normal distribution for the data and may lead to distorted inferences. Conversely, imputations under the Hurdle Model are more realistic, as they can replicate values in the whole range of the observed data, including the structural ones. Imputed unit QALYs with no discernible interval are only observed in the intervention group due to the original data composition, i.e. individuals associated with a unit baseline utility and missing QALYs are almost exclusively present in the intervention group.\nConclusions We have presented a flexible Bayesian framework that can handle the typical complexities affecting outcome data in CEA, while also being relatively easy to implement using freely available Bayesian software. This is a key advantage that can encourage practitioners to move away from likely biased methods and promote the use of our framework in routine analyses. In conclusion, the proposed framework can:\n Jointly model costs and QALYs; Account for skewness and structural values; Assess the robustness of the results under a set of differing missingness assumptions.  The original contribution of this work consists in the joint implementation of methods that account for the complexities of the data within a unique and flexible framework that is relatively easy to apply. In the next chapter we will take a step forward in the analysis and present a longitudinal model that can use all observed utility and cost data in the analysis, explore alternative nonignorable missing data assumptions, while simultaneously handling the complexities that affect the data.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"159ff484bc950a41748df648cbd474ee","permalink":"/project/bayesian-modelling/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bayesian-modelling/","section":"project","summary":"With [Alexina Mason](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/mason.alexina) and [Gianluca Baio](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/gianlucabaio)","tags":["Bayesian Modelling","Health Economics"],"title":"Bayesian Modelling for Health Economic Evaluations","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["rubric"],"content":"\rComplete case analysis (CCA), also known as case or listwise deletion (LD), is one of the oldest methods to handle missing data and consists in discarding any unit or case whose information is incomplete. Only the cases with observed values for all the variables under consideration are used in the analysis. For example, suppose we have a data set formed by \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) individuals and that we want to fit a linear regression on some outcome variable \\(y_i\\) using some other variables \\(x_{i1},\\ldots,x_{ik}\\) as covariates. CCA uses only the subset of cases with observed values on all the variables included in the analysis (completers).\nCCA has been a quite popular approach to deal with missingness, mainly because it is very easy to implement (used by default in many statistical programs) and it allows the comparison of different univariate statistics in a straightforward way (calculated on a common set of cases). However, there are a number of potential disadvantages which threatens the validity of this method:\nBias, when the missing data mechanism is not missing completely at random (MCAR) and the completers are not a random samples of all the cases\n\rLoss of efficiency, due to the potential loss of information in discarding the incomplete cases.\n\r\rCCA may be justified when the loss of precision and bias are minimal, which is more likley to occur when the proportion of completers is high, although it is difficult to formulate rules that apply in general circumstances. Indeed, both the degree of loss of precision and bias depend not only on the fraction of completers and missingness patterns, but also on the extent to which complete and incomplete cases differ and the parameters of interest.\nLet \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{cc}\\) be an estimate of a parameter of interest from the completers. One might measure the increase in variance of \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{cc}\\) with respect to the estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) that would be obtained in the absence of missing values. Using the notation of Little and Rubin (2019):\n\\[\r\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}_{cc}) = \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta})(1 + \\Delta^{\\star}_{cc}),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta^{\\star}_{cc}\\) is the proportional increase in variance from the loss of information. A more practical measure of the loss of inofrmation is \\(\\Delta_{cc}\\), where\n\\[\r\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}_{cc}) = \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}_{eff})(1 + \\Delta_{cc}),\r\\]\nand \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{eff}\\) is an efficient estimate based on all the available data.\nExample 1\rConsider bivariate normal monotone data \\(\\bf y = (y_1,y_2)\\), where \\(n_{cc}\\) out of \\(n\\) cases are complete and \\(n - n_{cc}\\) cases have observed values only on \\(y_1\\). Assume for simplicity that the missingness mechanism is MCAR and that the mean of \\(y_j\\) is estimated by the empirical mean from the complete cases \\(\\bar{y}^{cc}_j\\). Then, the loss in sample size for estimating the mean of \\(y_1\\) is:\n\\[\r\\Delta_{cc}(\\bar{y}_1) = \\frac{n - n_{cc}}{n_{cc}},\r\\]\nso that if half the cases are missing, the variance is doubled. For the mean of \\(y_2\\), the loss of information alos depends on the squared correlation \\(\\rho^{2}\\) between the variables: (Little and Rubin (2019))\n\\[\r\\Delta_{cc}(\\bar{y}_2) \\approx \\frac{(n - n_{cc})\\rho^{2}}{n_{cc}(1 - \\rho^{2}) + n_{cc}\\rho^{2}}.\r\\]\n\\(\\Delta_{cc}(\\bar{y}_2)\\) varies from zero (when \\(\\rho=0\\)) to \\(\\Delta_{cc}(\\bar{y}_1)\\) as \\(\\rho^{2} \\rightarrow 1\\). However, for the regression coefficients of \\(y_2\\) on \\(y_1\\) we have that \\(\\Delta_{cc}=0\\) since the incomplete observations of \\(y_1\\) provide no information for estimating the parameters of the regression of \\(y_2\\) on \\(y_1\\).\n\rExample 2\rFor inference about the population mean \\(\\mu\\), the bias of CCA depends on the proportion of the completers \\(\\pi_{cc}\\) and the extent to which complete and incomplete cases differ on the variables of interest. Suppose a variable \\(y\\) is partially-observed and that we partition the data into the subset of the completers \\(y_{cc}\\) and incompleters \\(y_{ic}\\), with associated population means \\(\\mu_{cc}\\) and \\(\\mu_{ic}\\), respectively. The overall mean can be written as a weighted average of the means of the two subsets\n\\[\r\\mu = \\pi_{cc}\\mu_{cc} + (1 - \\pi_{cc})\\mu_{ic}.\r\\]\nThe bias of CCA is then equal to the expected fraction of incomplete cases multiplied by the differences in the means for complete and incomplete cases\n\\[\r\\mu_{cc} - \\mu = (1 - \\pi_{cc})(\\mu_{cc} - \\mu_{ic}).\n\\]\nUnder MCAR, we have that \\(\\mu_{cc} = \\mu_{ic}\\) and therefore the bias is zero.\n\rExample 3\rConsider the estimation of the regression of \\(y\\) on \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_K\\) from data with potential missing values on all variables and with the regression function correctly specified. The bias of CCA for estimating the regression coefficients \\(\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_K\\) associated with the covariates is null if the probbaility of being a completer depends on the \\(x\\)s but not \\(y\\), since the analysis conditions on the values of the covariates (Glynn and Laird (1986), White and Carlin (2010)). This class of missing data mechanisms includes missing not at random (MNAR), where the probability that a covariate is missing depends on the value of that covariate. However, CCA is biased if the probability of being a completer depends on \\(y\\) after conditioning on the covariates. A nice example of this particular topic and its implications for the analysis has been provided by professor Bartlett using some nice slides\n\rConclusions\rThe main virtue of case deletion is simplicity. If a missing data problem can be resolved by discarding only a small part of the sample, then the method can be quite effective. However, even in that situation, one should explore the data (Schafer and Graham (2002)). The discarded information from incomplete cases can be used to study whether the complete cases are plausibly a random subsample of the original sample, that is, whether MCAR is a reasonable assumption. A simple procedure is to compare the distribution of a particular variable \\(y\\) based on complete cases with the distribution of \\(y\\) based on incomplete cases for which \\(y\\) is recorded. Significant differences indicate that the MCAR assumption is invalid, and the complete-case analysis yields potentially biased estimates. Such tests are useful but have limited power when the sample of incomplete cases is small. Also the tests can offer no direct evidence on the validity of the missing at random (MAR) assumption.\n\rReferences\rGlynn, RJ, and NM Laird. 1986. “Regression Estimates and Missing Data: Complete Case Analysis.” Cambridge MA: Harvard School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics.\n\rLittle, Roderick JA, and Donald B Rubin. 2019.

Suppose we have a model for the complete data \\(Y\\), with density \\(f(Y\\mid \\theta)\\), indexed by the set of unknown parameters \\(\\theta\\). Writing \\(Y=(Y_0,Y_1)\\) in terms of the observed \\(Y_0\\) and missing \\(Y_1\\) components, and assuming that the missingness mechanism is Missing At Random(MAR), we want to maximise the likelihood\n\\[\rL\\left(\\theta \\mid Y_0 \\right) = \\int f\\left(Y_0, Y_1 \\mid \\theta \\right)dY_1\r\\]\nwith respect to \\(\\theta\\).

One of these methods is the popular Expectation Maximisation(EM) algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin (1977)).\nThe EM algorithm is a general iterative method for ML estimation in incomplete data problems. The basic idea behind it is based on a sequence of steps:\n\rReplace missing values by estimated values\n\rEstimate the parameters\n\rRe-estimate the missing values assuming the new parameter estimates are correct\n\rRe-estimate parameters\n\r\rThe procedure is then iterated until apparent convergence. Each iteration of EM consists of an expectation step (E step) and a maximisation step (M step) which ensure that, under general conditions, each iteration increases the loglikelihood \\(l(\\theta \\mid Y_0)\\). In addition, if the loglikelihood is bounded, the sequence \\(\\{l(\\theta_t \\mid Y_0), t=(0,1,\\ldots)\\}\\) converges to a stationary value of \\(l(\\theta \\mid Y_0)\\).\nThe E step and the M step\rThe M step simply consists of performing ML estimation of \\(\\theta\\) as if there were no missing data, that is, after they had been filled in. The E step finds the conditional expectation of the missing values given the observed data and current estimated parameters. In practice, EM does not necessarily substitute the missing values themselves but its key idea is that they are generally not \\(Y_0\\) but the functions of \\(Y_0\\) appearing in the complete data loglikelihood \\(l(\\theta \\mid Y)\\). Specifically, let \\(\\theta_t\\) be the current estimate of \\(\\theta\\), then the E step finds the expected complete data loglikelihood if \\(\\theta\\) were \\(\\theta_t\\):\n\\[\rQ\\left(\\theta \\mid \\theta_t \\right) = \\int l\\left(\\theta \\mid Y \\right)f\\left(Y_0 \\mid Y_1 , \\theta = \\theta_t \\right)dY_0.\r\\]\nThe M step determines \\(\\theta_{t+1}\\) by maximising this expected complete data loglikelihood:\n\\[\rQ\\left(\\theta_{t+1} \\mid \\theta_t \\right) \\geq Q\\left(\\theta \\mid \\theta_t \\right),\r\\]\nfor all \\(\\theta\\).\nUnivariate Normal Data Example\rSuppose \\(y_i\\) form a an iid sample from a Normal distribution with population mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n_{cc}\\) observed units and \\(i=n_{cc}+1,\\ldots,n\\) missing units. Under the assumption that the missingness mechanism is ignorable, the expectation of each missing \\(y_i\\) given \\(Y_{obs}\\) and \\(\\theta=(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) is \\(\\mu\\). Since the loglikelihood based on all \\(y_i\\) is linear in the sufficient statistics \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\) and \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n y^2_i\\), the E step of the algorithm calculates\n\\[\rE\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i \\mid \\theta_t, Y_0 \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{cc}}y_i + (n-n_{cc})\\mu_t\r\\]\nand\n\\[\rE\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}y^2_i \\mid \\theta_t, Y_0 \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{cc}}y^2_i + (n-n_{cc})\\left(\\mu^2_t + \\sigma^2_t \\right)\r\\]\nfor current estimates \\(\\theta_t=(\\mu_t,\\sigma_t)\\) of the parameters. Note that simply substituting \\(\\mu_t\\) for the missing values \\(y_{n_{cc}+1},\\ldots,y_n\\) is not correct since the term \\((n-n_{cc})(\\sigma_t^2)\\) is omitted. Without missing data, the ML estimate of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are \\(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i}{n}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^ny^2_i}{n}-\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i}{n}\\right)^2\\), respectively. The M step uses the same expressions based on the current expectations of the sufficient statistics calculated in the E step. Thus, the M step calculates\n\\[\r\\mu_{t+1} = \\frac{E\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\mid \\theta_t, Y_0 \\right)}{n}\r\\]\nand\n\\[\r\\sigma^2_{t+1} = \\frac{E\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n y^2_i \\mid \\theta_t, Y_0 \\right)}{n} - \\mu^2_{t+1}.\r\\]\nSetting \\(\\mu_t=\\mu_{t+1}=\\hat{\\mu}\\) and \\(\\sigma_t=\\sigma_{t+1}=\\hat{\\sigma}\\) in these equations shows that a fixed point of these iterations is \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{cc}}y_i}{n_{cc}}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{cc}}y^2_i}{n_{cc}} - \\hat{\\mu}^2\\), which are the ML estimates of the parameters from \\(Y_0\\) assuming MAR and distinctness of the parameters.\n\r\rExtensions of EM\rThere are a variety of applications where the M step does not have a simple computational form. In such cases, one way to avoid an iterative M step is to increase the Q function, rather than maximising it at each iteration, which corresponds to a Generalised Expectation Maximisation(GEM) algorithm. GEM inceases the likelihood at each iteration but appropriate convergence is not guaranteed without further specification of the process of increasing the Q function. One specific case of GEM is the Expectation Conditional Maximisation(ECM) algorithm (Meng and Rubin (1993)), which replaces the M step with a sequence of \\(S\\) conditional maximisation (CM) steps, each of which maximises the Q function over \\(\\theta\\) but with some vector function of \\(\\theta\\), say \\(g_s(\\theta)\\), fixed at its previous values for \\(s=1,\\ldots,S\\). Very briefly, assume that we have a parameter \\(\\theta\\) that can be partitioned into subvectors \\(\\theta=(\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_S)\\), then we can take the \\(s\\)-th of the CM steps to be maximisation with respect to \\(\\theta_s\\) with all other parameters held fixed. Alternatively, it may be useful to take the \\(s\\)-th of the CM steps to be simultaneous maximisation over all of the subvectors expect \\(\\theta_s\\), which is fixed. Because the ECM increases Q, it belongs to the class of GEM algorithms and therefore monotonically increases the likelihood of \\(\\theta\\). When the set of functions \\(g\\) is “space filling” in the sense that it allows unconstrained maximisation over \\(\\theta\\) in its parameter space, ECM converges to a stationary point under the same conditions ensuring convergence of EM.\nThe Expectation Conditional Maximisation Either(ECME) algorithm (Liu and Rubin (1994)) is another version of GEM, which replaces some of the CM steps of ECM, maximising the constrained expected complete data loglikelihood function, with steps that maximise the correspondingly constrained actual likelihood function. The algorithm has stable monotone convergence and basic simplicity implementation relative to competing faster converging methods, and can have faster convergence rate than EM or ECM, measured using either the number of iterations or actual computer time. The The Alternative Expectation Conditional Maximisation(AECM) algorithm (Meng and Van Dyk (1997)) builds on the ECME idea by maximising functions other than Q or L in particular CM steps, corresponding to varying definitions of what constitutes missing data. An iteration of AECM consists of cycles, each consisting of an E step with a particular definition of complete and missing data, followed by CM steps, which can result in enhanced computational efficiency.\n\rReferences\rDempster, Arthur P, Nan M Laird, and Donald B Rubin. 1977. “Maximum Likelihood from Incomplete Data via the Em Algorithm.” Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Methodological) 39 (1): 1–22.\n\rLiu, Chuanhai, and Donald B Rubin. 1994. “The Ecme Algorithm: A Simple Extension of Em and Ecm with Faster Monotone Convergence.” Biometrika 81 (4): 633–48.\n\rMeng, Xiao-Li, and Donald B Rubin. 1993. “Maximum Likelihood Estimation via the Ecm Algorithm: A General Framework.” Biometrika 80 (2): 267–78.\n\rMeng, Xiao-Li, and David Van Dyk. 1997. “The Em Algorithm—an Old Folk-Song Sung to a Fast New Tune.” Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Statistical Methodology) 59 (3): 511–67.\n\r\r\r","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"5d1ab0b24b19df7c82eb56dcf0551da2","permalink":"/missmethods/em-algorithm/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/missmethods/em-algorithm/","section":"missmethods","summary":"Patterns of incomplete data in practice often do not have the forms that allow explicit Maximum Likelihood(ML) estimates to be calculated.

Clearly, this is inefficient and a tempting alternative would be to impute or “fill in” the unobserved data with some plausible values. When a single value is used to replace each missing data, we talk about Single Imputation(SI) methods and, according to the precedure used to generate these imputations, different SI methods can be used. In general, the idea of imputing the missing values is really appealing as it allows to recover the full sample on which standard complete data methods can be applied to derive the estimates of interest.\nHowever, it is important to be aware of the potential problems of imputing missing data without a clear understanding about the process underlying the values we want to impute, which is the key factor to determine whether the selected approach would be plausible in the context considered. Indeed, imputation should be conceptualised as draws from a predictive distribution of the missing values and require methods for creating a predictive distribution for the imputation based on the observed data. According to Little and Rubin (2019), these predictive distributions can be created using\nExplicit modelling, when the distribution is based on formal statistical models which make the underlying assumptions explicit.\n\rImplicit modelling, when the distribution is based on an algorithm which implicitly relies on some underlying model assumptions.\n\r\rIn this part, we focus on some of the most popular Explicit Single Imputation methods. These include: Mean Imputation(SI-M), where means from the observed data are used as imputed values; Regression Imputation(SI-R), where missing values are replaced with values predicited from a regression of the missing variable on some other observed variables; and Stochastic Regression Imputation(SI-SR), where unobserved data are substituted with the predicted values from a regression imputation plus a randomly selected residual drawn to reflect uncertainty in the predicted values.\nMean Imputation\rThe simplest type of SI-M consists in replacing the missing values in a variable with the mean of the observed units from the same variable, a method known as Unconditional Mean Imputation (Little and Rubin (2019),Schafer and Graham (2002)). Let \\(y_{ij}\\) be the value of variable \\(j\\) for unit \\(i\\), such that the unconditional mean based on the observed values of \\(y_j\\) is given by \\(\\bar{y}_j\\). The sample mean of the observed and imputed values is then \\(\\bar{y}^{m}_j=\\bar{y}^{ac}_j\\), i.e. the estimate from ACA, while the sample variance is given by\n\\[\rs^{m}_{j}=s^{ac}_{j}\\frac{(n^{ac}-1)}{(n-1)},\r\\]\nwhere \\(s^{ac}_j\\) is the sample variance estimated from the \\(n^{ac}\\) available units. Under a Missing Completely At Random(MCAR) assumption, \\(s^{ac}_j\\) is a consistent estimator of the tru variance so that the sample variance from the imputed data \\(s^m_j\\) systematically underestimates the true variance by a factor of \\(\\frac{(n^{ac}-1)}{(n-1)}\\), which clearly comes from the fact that missing data are imputed using values at the centre of the distribution. The imputation distorts theempirical distribution of the observed values as well as any quantities that are not linear in the data (e.g. variances, percentiles, measures of shape). The sampel covariance of \\(y_j\\) and \\(y_k\\) from the imputed data is\n\\[\rs^{m}_{jk}=s^{ac}_{jk}\\frac{(n^{as}_{jk}-1)}{(n-1)},\r\\]\nwhere \\(n^{ac}_{jk}\\) is the number of units with both variables observed and \\(s^{ac}_{jk}\\) is the corresponding covariance estimate from ACA. Under MCAR \\(s^{ac}_{jk}\\) is a consistent estimator of the true covariance, so that \\(s^{m}_{jk}\\) underestimates the magnitude of the covariance by a factor of \\(\\frac{(n^{ac}_{jk}-1)}{(n-1)}\\). Obvious adjustments for the variance (\\(\\frac{(n-1)}{(n^{ac}_j-1)}\\)) and the covariance (\\(\\frac{(n-1)}{(n^{ac}_{jk}-1)}\\)) yield ACA estimates, which could lead to covariance matrices that are not positive definite.\n\rRegression Imputation\rAn improvement over SI-M is to impute each missing data using the conditional means given the observed values, a method known SI-R or Conditional Mean Imputation. To be precise, it would also be possible to impute conditional means without using a regression approach, for example by grouping individuals into adjustment classes (analogous to weighting methods) based on the observed data and then impute the missing values using the observed means in each adjustment class (Little and Rubin (2019)). However, for the sake of simplicity, here we will assume that SI-R and conditional mean imputation are the same.\nTo generate imputations under SI-R, consider a set of \\(J-1\\) fully observed response variables \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_{J-1}\\) and a partially observed response variable \\(y_J\\) which has the first \\(n_{cc}\\) units observed and the remaiing \\(n-n_{cc}\\) units missing. SI-R computes the regression of \\(y_J\\) on \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_{J-1}\\) based on the \\(n_{cc}\\) complete units and then fills in the missing values as predictions from the regression. For example, for unit \\(i\\), the missing value \\(y_{iJ}\\) is imputed using\n\\[\r\\hat{y}_{iJ}=\\hat{\\beta}_{J0}+\\sum_{j=1}^{J-1}\\hat{\\beta}_{Jj}y_{ij},\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{J0}\\) is the intercept and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{Jj}\\) is the \\(j\\) coefficient of of the regression of \\(y_J\\) on \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_{J-1}\\) based on the \\(n_{cc}\\) units.\nAn extension of regression imputation to a general pattern of missing data is known as Buck’s method (Buck (1960)). This approach first estimates the population mean \\(\\mu\\) and covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) from the sample mean and covariance matrix of the complete units and then uses these estimates to calculate the OLS regressions of the missing variables on the observed variables for each missing data pattern. Predictions of the missing data for each observation are obtained by replacing the values of the present variables in the regressions. The average of the observed and imputed values from this method are consistent estimates of the means and MCAR and mild assumptions about the moments of the distribution (Buck (1960)). They are also consistent when the missingness mechanism depends on observed variables, i.e. under a Missing At Random(MAR) assumption, although addtional assumptions are required in this case (e.g. using linear regressions it assumes that the “true” regression of the missing varables on the observed variables is linear).\nThe filled in data from Buck’s method typically yield reasonable estimates of means, while the sample variances and covariances are biased, although the bias is less than the one associated with unconditional mean imputation. Specifically, the sample variance \\(\\sigma^{2,SI-R}_j\\) from the imputed data underestimates the true variance \\(\\sigma^2_j\\) by a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sigma^{2}_{ji}\\), where \\(\\sigma^{2}_{ji}\\) is the residual variance from regressing \\(y_j\\) on the variables observed in unit \\(i\\) if \\(y_{ij}\\) is missing and zero if \\(y_{ij}\\) is observed. The sample covariance of \\(y_j\\) and \\(y_k\\) has a bias of \\(\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sigma_{jki}\\), where \\(\\sigma_{jki}\\) is the residual covariance from the multivariate regression of \\((y_{ij},y_{ik})\\) on the variables observed in unit \\(i\\) if both variables are missing and zero otherwise. A consistent estimator of \\(\\Sigma\\) can be constructed under MCAR by replacing consistent estimates of \\(\\sigma^{2}_{ji}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{jki}\\) in the expressions for bias and then adding the resulting quantities to the sample covariance matrix of the filled-in data.\n\rStochastic Regression Imputation\rAny type of mean or regression imputation will lead to bias when the interest is in the tails of the distributions because “best prediction” imputation systematically underestimates variability and standard errors calculated from the imputed data are typically too small. These considerations suggest an alternative imputation strategy, where imputed values are drawn from a predictive distribution of a plausible set of values rather than from the centre of the distribution. This is the idea behind SI-SR, which imputes a conditional draw\n\\[\r\\hat{y}_{iJ}=\\hat{\\beta}_{J0}+\\sum_{j=1}^{J-1}\\hat{\\beta}_{Jj}y_{ij}+z_{iJ},\r\\]\nwhere \\(z_{iJ}\\) is a random normal deviate with mean 0 and variance \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2_J\\), the residual variance from the regression of \\(y_J\\) on \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_{J-1}\\) based on the complete units. The addition of the random deviate makes the imputation a random draw from the predictive distribution of the missing values, rather than the mean, which is likely to ameliorate the distortion of the predictive distributions (Little and Rubin (2019)).\nExample\rConsider a bivariate normal monotone missing data with \\(y_1\\) fully observed and \\(y_2\\) missing for a fraction \\(\\lambda=\\frac{(n-n_{cc})}{n}\\) and a MCAR mechanism. The following table shows the large sample bias of standard OLS estimates obtained from the filled-in data about the mean, the variance of \\(y_2\\), the regression coefficient of \\(y_2\\) on \\(y_1\\), and the regression coefficient of \\(y_1\\) on \\(y_2\\), using four different single imputation methods: uncondtional mean (UM), unconditional draw (UD), conditional mean (CM), and conditional draw (CD).\n\rTable 1: Bivariate normal monotone MCAR data; large sample bias of four imputation methods.\r\r\r\r\rmu_2\r\rsigma_2\r\rbeta_21\r\rbeta_12\r\r\r\r\r\rUM\r\r0\r\r-lambda * sigma_2\r\r-lambda * beta_21\r\r0\r\r\r\rUD\r\r0\r\r0\r\r-lambda * beta_21\r\r-lambda * beta_21\r\r\r\rCM\r\r0\r\r-lambda * (1-rho^2) * sigma_2\r\r0\r\r((lambda * (1-rho^2)) / (1-lambda * (1-rho^2)) ) * beta_12\r\r\r\rCD\r\r0\r\r0\r\r0\r\r0\r\r\r\r\rUnder MCAR, all four methods yield consistent estimates of \\(\\mu_2\\) but both UM and CM underestimate the variance \\(\\sigma_2\\), UD leads to attenuation of the regression coefficients, while CD yields consistent estimates of all four parameters. However, CD has some important drawbacks. First, adding random draws to the conditional mean imputations is inefficient as the large sample variance of the CD estimates of \\(\\mu_2\\) can be shown (Little and Rubin (2019)) to be\n\\[\r\\frac{[1-\\lambda\\rho^2+(1-\\rho^2)\\lambda(1-\\lambda)]\\sigma_2}{n_{cc}},\r\\]\nwhich is larger than the large sample sampling variance of the CM estimate of \\(\\mu_2\\), namely \\(\\frac{[1-\\lambda\\rho^2]\\sigma_2}{n_{cc}}\\). Second, the standard errors of the CD estimates from the imputed data are too small because they do not incorporate imputation uncertainty.\nWhen the analysis involves units with some covariates missing and other observed, it is common practice to condition on the observed covariates when generating the imputations for the missing covariates. It is also possible to condition on the outcome \\(y\\) to impute missing covariates, even if the final objective is to regress \\(y\\) on the full set of covariates and conditioning on \\(y\\) will lead to bias when conditional means are imputed. However, if predictive draws are imputed, this approach will yield consistent estimates of the regression coefficients. Imputing missing covariates using the means by conditioning only the observed covariates (and not also on \\(y\\)) also yields consistent estimates of the regression coefficients under certain conditions, although these are typically less efficient then those from CCA, but yields inconsistent estimates of other parameters such as variances and correlations (Little (1992)).\n\r\rConclusions\rAccording to Little and Rubin (2019), imputation should generally be\nConditional on observed variables, to reduce bias, improve precision and preserve association between variables.\n\rMultivariate, to preserve association between missing variables.\n\rDraws from the predictive distributions rather than means, to provide valid estimates of a wide range of estimands.\n\r\rNevertheless, a main problem of SI methods is that inferences based on the imputed data do not account for imputation uncertainty and standard errors are therefore systematically underestimated, p-values of tests are too significant and confidence intervals are too narrow.\n\rReferences\rBuck, Samuel F. 1960. “A Method of Estimation of Missing Values in Multivariate Data Suitable for Use with an Electronic Computer.” Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Methodological) 22 (2): 302–6.\n\rLittle, Roderick JA. 1992. “Regression with Missing X’s: A Review.” Journal of the American Statistical Association 87 (420): 1227–37.\n\rLittle, Roderick JA, and Donald B Rubin. 2019.

When a single value is used to replace each missing data, we talk about Single Imputation(SI) methods and, according to the precedure used to generate these imputations, different SI methods can be used. In general, the idea of imputing the missing values is really appealing as it allows to recover the full sample on which standard complete data methods can be applied to derive the estimates of interest.\nHowever, it is important to be aware of the potential problems of imputing missing data without a clear understanding about the process underlying the values we want to impute, which is the key factor to determine whether the selected approach would be plausible in the context considered. Indeed, imputation should be conceptualised as draws from a predictive distribution of the missing values and require methods for creating a predictive distribution for the imputation based on the observed data. According to Little and Rubin (2019), these predictive distributions can be created using\nExplicit modelling, when the distribution is based on formal statistical models which make the underlying assumptions explicit.\n\rImplicit modelling, when the distribution is based on an algorithm which implicitly relies on some underlying model assumptions.\n\r\rIn this part, we focus on some of the most popular Implicit Single Imputation methods. These include: Hot Deck Imputation(SI-HD), where missing values are imputed using observed values from similar responding units in the sample; Substitution(SI-S), where nonresponding units are replaced with alternative units not yet selected into the sample; Cold Deck Imputation(SI-CD), where missing values are replaced with a constant value from an external source; Composite Methods, which combine procedures from the previous approaches. We will specifically focus on SI-HD methods, which are the most popular among these.\nHot Deck Imputation\rSI-HD procedures refer to the deck of match Hollerith cards for the donors available for a nonrespondent. Suppose that a sample of \\(n\\) out of \\(N\\) units is selected and that \\(n_{cc}\\) out of \\(n\\) are recorded. Given an equal probability sampling scheme, the mean of \\(y\\) can be estimated from the filled-in data as the mean of the responding and the imputed units\n\\[\r\\bar{y}_{HD}=\\frac{(n_{cc}\\bar{y}_{cc}+(n-n_{cc})\\bar{y}^{\\star})}{n},\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{y}_{cc}\\) is the mean of the responding units, and \\(\\bar{y}^\\star=\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{cc}}\\frac{H_iy_i}{n-n_{cc}}\\). \\(H_i\\) is the number of times \\(y_i\\) is used as substitute for a missing value of \\(y\\), with \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{cc}}H_i=n-n_{cc}\\) being the number of missing units. The proprties of \\(bar{y}_{HD}\\) depend on the procedure used to generate the numbers \\(H_i\\) and in general the mean and sampling variance of this estimator can be written as\n\\[\rE[\\bar{y}_{HD}]=E[E[\\bar{y}_{HD}\\mid y_{obs}]] ;;; \\text{and} ;;; Var(\\bar{y}_{HD})=Var(E[\\bar{y}_{HD} \\mid y_{obs}]) + E[Var(\\bar{y}_{HD} \\mid y_{obs})],\r\\]\nwhere the inner expectations and variances are taken over the distribution of \\(H_i\\) given the observed data \\(y_{obs}\\), and the outer expectations and variances are taken over the model distribution of \\(y\\). The term \\(E[Var(\\bar{y}_{HD} \\mid y_{obs})]\\) represents the additional sampling variance from the stochastic imputation procedure. Examples of these procedures include predictive mean matching or PMM(Little and Rubin (2019)) and last value carried forward or LVCF(Little and Rubin (2019)).\nPredictive Mean Matching\rA general approach to hot-deck imputation is to define a metric \\(d(i,j)\\) measuring the distance between units based on observed variables \\(x_{i1},\\ldots,x_{iJ}\\) and then choose the imputed values that come from responding units close to the unit with the missing value, i.e. we choose the imputed value for \\(y_i\\) from a donor pool of units \\(j\\) that are such that \\(y_j,x_1,\\ldots,x_J\\) are observed and \\(d(i,j)\\) is less than some value \\(d_0\\). Varying the value for \\(d_0\\) can control the number of available donors \\(j\\). When the choice of the metric has the form\n\\[\rd(i,j)=(\\hat{y}(x_i)-\\hat{y}(x_j))^2,\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{y}(x_i)\\) is the predicted value of \\(y\\) from the regression of \\(y\\) on \\(x\\) from the complete units, then the procedure is known as PMM. A powerful aspect of this metric is that it weights predictors according to their ability to predict the missing variable, which allows to have some protection against misspecification of the regression of \\(y\\) on \\(x\\), even though better approaches are available when good matches to donor units cannot be found or the sample size is small.\n\rLast Value Carried Forward\rLongitudinal data are often subject to attrition when units leave the study prematurely. Let \\(y_i=(y_{i1},\\ldots,y_{iJ})\\) be a \\((J\\times1)\\) vector of partially-observed outcomes for subject \\(i\\), and denote with \\(y_{i,obs}\\) and \\(y_{i,mis}\\) the observed and missing components of \\(y_i\\), i.e. \\(y=(y_{i,obs},y_{i,mis})\\). Define the indicator variable \\(m_i\\) taking value 0 for complete units and \\(j\\) if subject \\(i\\) drops out between \\(j-1\\) and \\(j\\) time points. LVCF, also called last observation carried forward(Pocock (2013)), imputes all missing values for individual \\(i\\) (for whom \\(m_i=j\\)) using the last recorded value for that unit, that is\n\\[\r\\hat{y}_{it}=y_{i,j-1},\r\\]\nwhere \\(t=j,\\ldots,J\\). Although simple, this approach makes the often unrealistic assumption that the value of the outcome remains unchanged after dropout.\n\r\rConclusions\rAccording to Little and Rubin (2019), imputation should generally be\nConditional on observed variables, to reduce bias, improve precision and preserve association between variables.\n\rMultivariate, to preserve association between missing variables.\n\rDraws from the predictive distributions rather than means, to provide valid estimates of a wide range of estimands.\n\r\rNevertheless, a main problem of SI methods is that inferences based on the imputed data do not account for imputation uncertainty and standard errors are therefore systematically underestimated, p-values of tests are too significant and confidence intervals are too narrow.\n\rReferences\rLittle, Roderick JA, and Donald B Rubin. 2019.

In this section, I review basic concepts of Bayesian inference based on fully observed data, with notation and structure mostly taken from Gelman et al. (2013).\nBayesian Inference for Complete Data\rBayesian inference is the process of fitting a probability model to a set of data \\(Y\\) and summarising the results by a probability distribution on the parameters \\(\\theta\\) of the model and on unobserved quantities \\(\\tilde{Y}\\) (e.g. predictions). Indeed, Bayesian statistical conclusions about \\(\\theta\\) (or \\(\\tilde{Y}\\)) are made in terms of probability statements, conditional on the observed data \\(Y\\), typically indicated with the notation \\(p(\\theta \\mid y)\\) or \\(p(\\tilde{y} \\mid y)\\). Conditioning on the observed data is what makes Bayesian inference different from standard statistical approaches which are instead based on the retrospective evaluation of the procedures used to estimate \\(\\theta\\) (or \\(\\tilde{y}\\)) over the distribution of possible \\(y\\) values conditional on the “true” unknown value of \\(\\theta\\).\nBayes’ Rule\rIn order to make probability statements about \\(\\theta\\) given \\(y\\), we start with a model providing a joint probability distribution \\(p(\\theta,y)\\). Thus, the joint probability mass or density function can be written as a product of two densities that are often referred to as the prior distribution \\(p(\\theta)\\) and the sampling distribution \\(p(y \\mid \\theta)\\), respectively:\n\\[\rp(\\theta,y) = p(\\theta)p(y \\mid \\theta),\r\\]\nand conditioning on the observed values of \\(y\\), using the basic property of conditional probability known as Bayes’ rule, yields the posterior distribution\n\\[\rp(\\theta \\mid y) = \\frac{p(\\theta,y)}{p(y)} = \\frac{p(\\theta)p(y \\mid \\theta)}{p(y)},\r\\]\nwhere \\(p(y)=\\sum_{\\theta \\in \\Theta}p(\\theta)p(y\\mid \\theta)\\) is the sum (or integral in the case of continous \\(\\theta\\)) over all possible values of \\(\\theta\\) in the sample space \\(\\Theta\\). We can approximate the above equation by omitting the factor \\(p(y)\\) which does not depend on \\(\\theta\\) and, given \\(y\\), can be considered as fixed, yielding the unnormalised posterior density\n\\[\rp(\\theta \\mid y) \\propto p(\\theta) p(y \\mid \\theta),\r\\]\nwith the purpose of the analysis being to develop the model \\(p(\\theta,y)\\) and adequately summarise \\(p(\\theta \\mid y)\\).\n\rUnivariate Normal Example (known variance)\rLet \\(y=(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)\\) denote an independent and identially distributed sample of \\(n\\) units, which are assumed to come from a Normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), whose sampling density function is\n\\[\rp(y \\mid \\mu)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left(2\\pi\\sigma^2\\right)^n}}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(y_i-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2} \\right),\r\\]\nwhere for the moment we assume the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) to be known (i.e. constant). Consider now a prior probability distribution for the mean parameter \\(p(\\mu)\\), which belongs to the family of conjugate prior densities, for example a Normal distribution, and parameterised in terms of a prior mean \\(\\mu_0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2_0\\). Thus, its prior density function is\n\\[\rp(\\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2_0}}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(\\mu -\\mu_0)^2}{\\sigma^2} \\right),\r\\]\nunder the assumption tha the hyperparameters \\(\\mu_0\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_0\\) are known. The conjugate prior density implies that the posterior distribution for \\(\\mu\\) (with \\(\\sigma^2\\) assumed constant) belongs to the same family of distributions of the sampling function, that is Normal, but some algebra is required to reveal its specific form. In particular, the posterior density is\n\\[\rp(\\mu \\mid y) = \\frac{p(\\mu)p(y\\mid \\mu)}{p(y)} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2_0}}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left(2\\pi\\sigma^2\\right)^n}}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\left[\\frac{(\\mu - \\mu_0)^2}{\\sigma^2_0} + \\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{(y_i-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2} \\right] \\right).\r\\]\nExapanding the components, collecting terms and completing the square in \\(\\mu\\) gives\n\\[\rp(\\mu \\mid y) \\propto \\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{(\\mu - \\mu_1)}{2\\tau^2_1} \\right),\r\\]\nthat is the posterior distribution of \\(\\mu\\) given \\(y\\) is Normal with posterior mean \\(\\mu_1\\) and variance \\(\\tau^2_1\\), where\n\\[\r\\mu_1 = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\tau^2_0}\\mu_0 + \\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}\\bar{y}}{\\frac{1}{\\tau^2_0} + \\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}} \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; \\frac{1}{\\tau^2_1}=\\frac{1}{\\tau^2_0} + \\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}.\r\\]\nWe can see that the posterior distribution depends on \\(y\\) only through the sample mean \\(\\bar{y}=\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i\\), which is a sufficient statistic in this model. When working with Normal distributions, the inverse of the variance plays a prominent role and is called the precision and, from the above expressions, it can be seen that for normal data and prior, the posterior precision \\(\\frac{1}{\\tau^2_1}\\) equals the sum of the prior precision \\(\\frac{1}{\\tau^2_0}\\) and the sampling precision \\(\\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}\\). Thus, when \\(n\\) is large, the posterior precision is largely dominated by \\(\\sigma^2\\) and the sample mean \\(\\bar{y}\\) compared to the corresponding prior parameters. In the specific case where \\(\\tau^2_0=\\sigma^2\\), the prior has the same weight as one extra observation with the value of \\(\\mu_0\\) and, as \\(n\\rightarrow\\infty\\), we have that \\(p(\\mu\\mid y)\\approx N\\left(\\mu \\mid \\bar{y},\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right)\\).\n\rUnivariate Normal Example (unknown variance)\rFor \\(p(y \\mid \\mu,\\sigma^2)=N(y \\mid \\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) with \\(\\mu\\) known and \\(\\sigma^2\\) unknown, the sampling distribution for a vector \\(y\\) of \\(n\\) units is\n\\[\rp(y \\mid \\sigma^2)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left(2\\pi\\sigma^2\\right)^n}}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(y_i-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2} \\right),\r\\]\nwith the corresponding conjugate prior for \\(\\sigma^2\\) being the Inverse-Gamma distribution \\(\\Gamma^{-1}(\\alpha,\\beta)\\) with density function\n\\[\rp(\\sigma^2) \\propto (\\sigma^2)^{-(\\alpha+1)}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{\\sigma^2}\\right),\r\\]\nindexed by the hyperparameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). A convenient parameterisation is as a Scaled Inverse-Chi Squared distribution \\(\\text{Inv-}\\chi^2(\\sigma^2_0,\\nu_0)\\) with scale and degrees of freedom parameters \\(\\sigma^2_0\\) and \\(\\nu_0\\), respectively. This means that the prior on \\(\\sigma^2\\) corresponds to the distribution of \\(\\frac{\\sigma^2_0 \\nu_0}{X}\\), where \\(X\\sim \\chi^2_{\\nu_0}\\) random variable. After some calculations, the resulting posterior for \\(\\sigma^2\\) is\n\\[\rp(\\sigma^2 \\mid y) \\propto (\\sigma^2)^\\left(\\frac{n+\\nu_0}{2}+1\\right)\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{\\nu_0 \\sigma^2_0 + n \\nu}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\nu=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\mu)^2\\). This corresponds to say that\n\\[\r\\sigma^2 \\mid y \\sim \\text{Inv-}\\chi^2\\left(\\nu_0 +n, \\frac{\\nu_0\\sigma^2_0+n\\nu}{\\nu_0 + n} \\right),\r\\]\nwith scale equal to the degrees of freedom-weighted average of the prior and data scales and degrees of freedom equal to the sum of the prior and data degrees of freedom.\n\rUnivariate Normal Example (unknown mean and variance)\rSuppose now that both the mean and variance parameters are unknown such that\n\\[\rp(y \\mid \\mu, \\sigma^2) \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2),\r\\]\nand that the interest is centred on making inference about \\(\\mu\\), that is we seek the conditional posterior distribution of the parameters of interest given the observed data \\(p(\\mu \\mid y)\\). This can be derived from the joint posterior distribution density \\(p(\\mu, \\sigma^2 \\mid y)\\) by averaging over all possible values of \\(\\sigma^2\\), that is\n\\[\rp(\\mu \\mid y)=\\int p(\\mu, \\sigma^2 \\mid y)d\\sigma^2,\r\\]\nor, alternatively, the joint posterior can be factored as the product of the marginal distribution of one parameter and the conditional distribution of the other given the former and then taking the average over the values of the “nuisance” parameter\n\\[\rp(\\mu \\mid y)=\\int p(\\mu \\mid \\sigma^2, y)p(\\sigma^2 \\mid y)d\\sigma^2.\r\\]\nThe integral forms are rarely computed in practice but this expression helps us to understand that posterior distributions can be expressed in terms of the product of marginal and conditional densities, first drawing \\(\\sigma^2\\) from its marginal and then \\(\\mu\\) from its conditional given the drawn value of \\(\\sigma^2\\), so that the integration is indirectly performed. For example, consider the Normal model with both unknown mean and variance and assume a vague prior density \\(p(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\propto (\\sigma^2)^{-1}\\) (corresponding to uniform prior on \\((\\mu, \\log\\sigma)\\)), then the joint posterior distribution is proportional to the sampling distribution multiplied by the factor \\((\\sigma^2)^{-1}\\), that is\n\\[\rp(\\mu,\\sigma^2 \\mid y)\\propto \\sigma^{-n-2}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\left[(n-1)s^2+n(\\bar{y}-\\mu)^2 \\right] \\right),\r\\]\nwhere \\(s^2=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar{y})^2\\) is the sample variance. Next, the conditional posterior density \\(p(\\mu \\mid \\sigma^2)\\) can be shown to be equal to\n\\[\rp(\\mu \\mid \\sigma^2,y) \\sim N(\\bar{y},\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}),\r\\]\nwhile the marginal posterior \\(p(\\sigma^2 \\mid y)\\) can be obtained by averaging the joint \\(p(\\mu,\\sigma^2\\mid y)\\) over \\(\\mu\\), that is\n\\[\rp(\\sigma^2 \\mid y)\\propto \\int \\left(\\sigma^{-n-2}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\left[(n-1)s^2+n(\\bar{y}-\\mu)^2 \\right] \\right)\\right)d\\mu,\r\\]\nwhich leads to\n\\[\rp(\\sigma^2 \\mid ,y) \\sim \\text{Inv-}\\chi^2(n-1,s^2).\r\\]\nTypically, \\(\\mu\\) represents the estimand of interest and the obejective of the analysis is therefore to make inference about the marginal distribution \\(p(\\mu \\mid y)\\), which can be obtained by integrating \\(\\sigma^2\\) out of the joint posterior\n\\[\rp(\\mu \\mid y)=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}p(\\mu,\\sigma^2\\mid y)d\\sigma^2 \\propto \\left[1+\\frac{n(\\mu-\\bar{y})}{(n-1)s^2} \\right]\r\\]\nwhich corresponds to a Student-\\(t\\) density with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom\n\\[\rp(\\mu \\mid y)\\sim t_{n-1}\\left(\\bar{y},\\frac{s^2}{n}\\right)\r\\]\n\rMultivariate Normal Example\rSimilar considerations to those applied to the univariate case can be extended to the multivariate case when \\(y\\) is formed by \\(J\\) components coming from the Multivariate Normal distribution\n\\[\rp(y\\mid \\mu, \\Sigma) \\sim N(\\mu, \\Sigma),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu\\) is a vector of length \\(J\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) is a \\(J\\times J\\) covariance matrix, which is symmetric and positive definite. The sampling distribution for a sample of \\(n\\) units is\n\\[\rp(y\\mid \\mu, \\Sigma) \\propto \\mid \\Sigma \\mid^{-n/2}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\mu)^{T}\\Sigma^{-1}(y_i-\\mu) \\right),\r\\]\nAs with the univariate normal model, we can derive the posterior distribution for \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) according to the factorisation used of the joint posterior and the prior distributions specified. For example, using the conjugate normal prior for the mean \\(p(\\mu)\\sim N(\\mu_0,\\Sigma_0)\\), given \\(\\Sigma\\) known, the posterior can be shown to be\n\\[\rp(\\mu \\mid y) \\sim N(\\mu_1,\\Sigma_1),\r\\]\nwhere the posterior mean is a weighted average of the data and prior mean with weights given by the data and prior precision matrices \\(\\mu_1=(\\Sigma^{-1}_0+n\\Sigma^{-1})^{-1} (\\Sigma_0^{-1}\\mu_0 + n\\Sigma^{-1}\\bar{y})\\), and the posterior precision is the sum of the data and prior precisions \\(\\Sigma^{-1}_1=\\Sigma^{-1}_0+n\\Sigma^{-1}\\).\nIn the situation in which both \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) are unknown, convenient conjugate prior distributions which generalise those used in the univariate case are the Inverse-Wishart for the covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\sim \\text{Inv-Wishart}(\\Lambda_0,\\nu_0)\\) and the Multivariate Normal for the mean \\(\\mu\\sim N(\\mu_0, \\Sigma_0)\\), where \\(\\nu_0\\) and \\(\\Lambda_0\\) represent the degrees of freedom and the scale matrix for the Inverse-Wishart distribution, while \\(\\mu_0\\) and \\(\\Sigma_0=\\frac{\\Sigma}{\\kappa_0}\\) are the prior mean and covariance matrix for the Multivariate Normal. Woking out the form of the posterior, it can be shown that the joint posterior distribution has the same form of the sampling distribution with parameters\n\\[\rp(\\mu \\mid \\Sigma, y) \\sim N(\\mu_1,\\Sigma_1) \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; p(\\Sigma \\mid y) \\sim \\text{Inv-Wishart}(\\Lambda_1,\\nu_1),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\Sigma_1=\\frac{\\Sigma}{\\kappa_1}\\), \\(\\mu_1=\\frac{1}{\\kappa_0+n}\\mu_0+\\frac{n}{\\kappa_0+n}\\bar{y}\\), \\(\\kappa_1=\\kappa_0+n\\), \\(\\nu_1=\\nu_0+n\\), and \\(\\Lambda_1=\\Lambda_0+\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar{y})(y_i-\\bar{y})^T+\\frac{\\kappa_0 n}{\\kappa_0+n}(\\bar{y}-\\mu_0)(\\bar{y}-\\mu_0)^2\\).\n\r\rRegression Models\rSuppose the data consist in \\(n\\) units measured on an outcome variable \\(y\\) and a set of \\(J\\) covariates \\(X=(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{J})\\) and assume that the distribution of \\(y\\) given \\(x\\) is Normal with mean \\(\\mu_i=\\beta_0+\\sum_{j=1}^J\\beta_jx_{ij}\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\)\n\\[\rp(y \\mid \\beta,\\sigma^2,X) \\sim N(X\\beta,\\sigma^2I),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta=(\\beta_0,\\ldots,\\beta_J)\\) is the set of regression coefficients and \\(I\\) is the \\(n\\times n\\) identity matrix. Within the normal regression model, a convenient vague prior distribution is uniform on \\((\\beta,\\log\\sigma)\\)\n\\[\rp(\\beta,\\sigma^2)\\propto\\sigma^{-2}.\r\\]\nAs with normal distributions with unknown mean and variance we can first determine the marginal posterior of \\(\\sigma^2\\) and factor the joint posterior as \\(p(\\beta,\\sigma^2)=p(\\beta \\mid \\sigma^2, y)p(\\sigma^2 \\mid y)\\) (omit X for simplicity). Then, the conditional distribtuion \\(p(\\beta \\mid \\sigma^2,y)\\) is Normal\n\\[\rp(\\beta \\mid \\sigma^2, y) \\sim N(\\hat{\\beta},V_{\\beta}\\sigma^2),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\beta}=(X^{T}X)^{-1}(X^{T}y)\\) and \\(V_{\\beta}=(X^{T}X)^{-1}\\). The marginal posterior \\(p(\\sigma^2 \\mid y)\\) has a scaled Inverse-\\(\\chi^2\\) form\n\\[\rp(\\sigma^2\\mid y) \\sim \\text{Inv-}\\chi^2(n-J,s^2),\r\\]\nwhere \\(s^2=\\frac{1}{n-J}(y-X\\hat{\\beta})^{T}(y-X\\hat{\\beta})\\). Finally, the marginal posterior \\(p(\\beta \\mid y)\\), averaging over \\(\\sigma^2\\), is multivariate \\(t\\) with \\(n-J\\) degrees of freedom, even though in practice since we can characterise the joint posterior by drawing from \\(p(\\sigma^2)\\) and then from \\(p(\\beta \\mid \\sigma^2)\\). When the anaysis is based on improper priors (do not have finite integral), it is important to check tha the posterior is proper. In the case of the regression model, the posterior for \\(\\beta \\mid \\sigma^2\\) is proper only if the number of observations is larger than the number of parameters \\(n\u0026gt;J\\), and that the rank of \\(X\\) equals \\(J\\) (i.e. the columns of \\(X\\) are linearly independent) in order for all \\(J\\) coefficients to be uniquely identified from the data.\n\rGeneralised Linear Models\rThe purpose of Generalised Linear Models(GLM) is to extend the idea of linear modelling to cases for which the linear relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(E[y\\mid X]\\) or the Normal distribution is not appropriate. GLMs are specified in three stages\nChoose the linear predictor \\(\\eta=X\\beta\\)\n\rChoose the link fuction \\(g()\\) that relates the linear predictor to the mean of the outcome variable \\(\\mu=g^{-1}(\\eta)\\)\n\rChoose the random component specifying the distribution of \\(y\\) with mean \\(E[y\\mid X]\\)\n\r\rThus, the mean of the distribution of \\(y\\) given \\(X\\) is determined as \\(E[y\\mid X]=g^{-1}(X\\beta)\\). The Normal linear model can be thought as a special case of GLMs where the link function is the identity \\(g(\\mu)=\\mu\\) and the random component is normally distributed. Perhaps, the most commonly used GLMs are those based on Poisson and Binomial distributions to analyse count and binary data, respectively.\nPoisson\rCounted data are often modelled using Poisson regression models which assume that \\(y\\) is distributed according to a Poisson distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\). The link function is typically chosen to be the logarithm so that \\(\\log \\mu = X\\beta\\) and the distribution of the data has density\n\\[\rp(y\\mid \\beta)=\\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{y_i}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\text{e}^{(\\eta_i)}(\\text{exp}(\\eta_i))^{y_i}\\right),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\eta_i=(X\\beta)_i\\) is the linear predictor for the \\(i-\\)th unit.\n\rBinomial\rSuppose there are some binomial data \\(y_i \\sim \\text{Bin}(n_i,\\mu_i)\\), with \\(n_i\\) known. It is common to specify the model in terms of the mean of the proportions \\(\\frac{y_i}{n_i}\\) rather than the mean of \\(y_i\\). Choosing the logit tranformation of the probability of success \\(g(\\mu_i)=\\log\\left(\\frac{\\mu_i}{1-\\mu_i}\\right)\\) as the link function leads to the logistic regression where data have distribution\n\\[\rp(y \\mid \\beta)=\\prod_{i=1}^n {n_i \\choose y_i} {e^{\\eta_i} \\choose 1+e^{\\eta_i}}^{y_i} {1 \\choose 1+e^{\\eta_i}}^{n_i-y_i}.\r\\]\nThe link functions used in the previous models are known as the canonical link functions for each family of distributions, which is the function of the mean parameter that appears in the exponent of the exponential family form of the probability density. However, it is also possible to use link functions which are not canonical.\n\r\rReferences\rGelman, Andrew, John B Carlin, Hal S Stern, David B Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald B Rubin. 2013.

In this section, I review maximum likelihood methods based on fully observed data alone.\nMaximum Likelihood Methods for Complete Data\rLet \\(Y\\) denote the set of data, which are assumed to be generated according to a certain probability density function \\(f(Y= y,\\mid \\theta)=f(y \\mid \\theta)\\) indexed by the set of parameters \\(\\theta\\), which lies on the parameter space \\(\\Theta\\) (i.e. set of values of \\(\\theta\\) for which \\(f(y\\mid \\theta)\\) is a proper density function). The Likelihood function, indicated with \\(L(\\theta \\mid y)\\), is defined as any function of \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\) proportional that is to \\(f(y \\mid \\theta)\\). Note that, in contrast to the density function which is defined as a function of the data \\(Y\\) given the values of the parameters \\(\\theta\\), instead the likelihood is defined as a function of the parameters \\(\\theta\\) for fixed data \\(y\\). In addition, the loglikelihood function, indicated with \\(l(\\theta\\mid y)\\) is defined as the natural logarithm of \\(L(\\theta \\mid y)\\).\nUnivariate Normal Example\rThe joint density function of \\(n\\) independent and identially distributed units \\(y=(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)\\) from a Normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), is\n\\[\rf(y \\mid \\mu, \\sigma^2)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left(2\\pi\\sigma^2\\right)^n}}\\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(y_i-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2} \\right),\r\\]\nand therefore the loglikelihood is\n\\[\rl(\\mu, \\sigma^2 \\mid y)= -\\frac{n}{2}\\text{ln}(2\\pi)-\\frac{n}{2}\\text{ln}(\\sigma^2)-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(y_i-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2},\r\\]\nwhich is considered as a function of \\(\\theta=(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) for fixed data \\(y\\).\n\rMultivariate Normal Example\rIf the sample considered has dimension \\(J\u0026gt;1\\), e.g. we have a set of idependent and identically distributed variables \\(y=(y_{ij})\\), for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) units and \\(j=1,\\ldots,J\\) variables, which comes from a Multivariate Normal distribution with mean vector \\(\\mu=(\\mu_1,\\ldots\\mu_J)\\) and covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma=(\\sigma_{jk})\\) for $ j=1,,J, k=1,,K$ and \\(J=K\\), then its density function is\n\\[\rf(y \\mid \\mu, \\Sigma)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left(2\\pi \\right)^{nK}\\left(\\mid \\Sigma \\mid \\right)^n}} \\text{exp}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\\mu)\\Sigma^{-1}(y_i-\\mu)^{T} \\right),\r\\]\nwhere \\(|\\Sigma|\\) denotes the determinant of the matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) and the superscript \\(T\\) denotes the transpose of a matrix or vector, while \\(y_i\\) denotes the row vector of observed values for unit \\(i\\).

Suppose a specific value for the parameter \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) such that \\(L(\\hat{\\theta}\\mid y)\\geq L(\\theta \\mid y)\\) for any other value of \\(\\theta\\). This implies that the observed data \\(y\\) is at least as likely under \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) as under any other value of \\(\\theta\\), i.e. \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is the value best supported by the data. More specifically, a maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\theta\\) is a value of \\(\\theta \\in \\Theta\\) that maximises the likelihood \\(L(\\theta \\mid y)\\) or, equivalently, that maximises the loglikelihood \\(l(\\theta \\mid y)\\). In general, when the likelihood is differentiable and bounded from above, typically the MLE can be found by differentiating \\(L(\\theta \\mid y)\\) or \\(l(\\theta \\mid y)\\) with respect to \\(\\theta\\), setting the result equal to zero, and solving for \\(\\theta\\). The resulting equation, \\(D_l(\\theta)=\\frac{\\partial l(\\theta \\mid y)}{\\partial \\theta}=0\\), is known as the likelihood equation and the derivative of the loglikelihood as the score function. When \\(\\theta\\) consists in a set of \\(j=1,\\ldots,J\\) components, then the likelihood equation corresponds to a set of \\(J\\) simultaneous equations, obtained by differentiating \\(l(\\theta \\mid y)\\) with respect to each component of \\(\\theta\\).\nUnivariate Normal Example\rRecall that, for a Normal sample with \\(n\\) units, the loglikelihood is indexed by the set of parameters \\(\\theta=(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) and has the form\n\\[\rl(\\mu, \\sigma^2 \\mid y)= -\\frac{n}{2}\\text{ln}(2\\pi)-\\frac{n}{2}\\text{ln}(\\sigma^2)-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{(y_i-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2}.\r\\]\nNext, the MLE can be derived by first differentiating \\(l(\\theta \\mid y)\\) with respect to \\(\\mu\\) and set the result equal to zero, that is\n\\[\r\\frac{\\partial l(\\theta \\mid y)}{\\partial \\mu}= -\\frac{2}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\mu)(-1)=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - n\\mu}{\\sigma^2}=0,\r\\]\nNext, after simplifying a bit, we can retrieve the solution\n\\[\r\\hat{\\mu}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i=\\bar{y},\r\\]\nwhich corresponds to the sample mean of the observations. Next, we differentiate \\(l(\\theta \\mid y)\\) with respect to \\(\\sigma^2\\), that is we set\n\\[\r\\frac{\\partial l(\\theta \\mid y)}{\\partial \\sigma^2}= -\\frac{n}{2\\sigma^2}+\\frac{1}{2(\\sigma^2)^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\mu)^2=0.\r\\]\nWe then simplify and move things around to get\n\\[\r\\frac{1}{\\sigma^3}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\mu)^2=\\frac{n}{\\sigma} \\;\\;\\; \\rightarrow \\;\\;\\; \\sigma^2=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\mu)^2.\r\\]\nFinally, we replace \\(\\mu\\) in the expression above with the value \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{y}\\) found before and obtain the solution\n\\[\r\\hat{\\sigma}^2=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\bar{y})^2=s^2,\r\\]\nwhich, however, is a biased estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\) and therefore is often replaced with the unbiased estimator \\(\\frac{s^2}{(n-1)}\\). In particular, given a population parameter \\(\\theta\\), the estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) for \\(\\theta\\) is said to be unbiased when \\(E[\\hat{\\theta}]=\\theta\\). This is the case, for example, of the sample mean \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{y}\\) which is an unbiased estimator of the population mean \\(\\mu\\):\n\\[\rE\\left[\\hat{\\mu} \\right]=E\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\right]=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n E\\left[y_i \\right]=\\frac{1}{n} (n\\mu)=\\mu.\r\\]\nHowever, this is not true for the sample variance \\(s^2\\). This can be seen by first rewriting the expression of the estimator as\n\\[\r\\hat{\\sigma}^2=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i^2 -2y_i\\bar{y}+\\bar{y}^2)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 -2\\bar{y}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i + \\frac{1}{n}n\\bar{y}^2=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 - \\bar{y}^2,\r\\]\nand then by computing the expectation of this quantity:\n\\[\rE\\left[\\hat{\\sigma}^2 \\right]=E\\left[\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 - \\bar{y}^2 \\right]=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n E\\left[y_i^2 \\right] - E\\left[\\bar{y}^2 \\right]=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (\\sigma^2 + \\mu^2) - (\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}+\\mu^2)=\\frac{1}{n}\\left(n\\sigma^2+n\\mu^2\\right) - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}-\\mu^2=\\frac{(n-1)\\sigma^2}{n}.\r\\]\nThe above result is obtained by pluggin in the expression for the variance of a general variable \\(y\\) and retrieving the expression for \\(E[y^2]\\) as a function of the variance and \\(E[y]^2\\). More specifically, given that\n\\[\rVar(y)=\\sigma^2=E\\left[y^2 \\right]-E\\left[y \\right]^2,\r\\]\nthen we know that for \\(y\\), \\(E\\left[y^2 \\right]=\\sigma^2+E[y]^2\\), and similarly we can derive the same expression for \\(\\bar{y}\\). However, we can see that \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) is biased by a factor of \\((n-1)/n\\). Thus, an unbiased estimator for \\(\\sigma^2\\) is given by multiplying \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) by \\(\\frac{n}{(n-1)}\\), which gives the unbiased estimator \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^{2\\star}=\\frac{s^2}{n-1}\\), where \\(E\\left[\\hat{\\sigma}^{2\\star}\\right]=\\sigma^2\\).\n\rMultivariate Normal Example\rThe same procedure can be applied to an independent and identically distributed multivariate sample \\(y=(y_{ij})\\), for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) units and \\(j=1,\\ldots,J\\) variables (Anderson (1962),Rao et al. (1973),Gelman et al. (2013)). It can be shown that, maximising the loglikelihood with respect to \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) yields the MLEs\n\\[\r\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{y} \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; \\Sigma=\\frac{(n-1)\\hat{\\sigma}^{2\\star}}{n},\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{y}=(\\bar{y}_1,\\ldots,\\bar{y}_{J})\\) is the row vectors of sample means and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^{2\\star}=(s^{\\star_{jk}})\\) is the sample covariance matrix with \\(jk\\)-th element \\(s^\\star_{jk}=\\frac{\\Sigma_{i=1}^n(y_{ij} - \\bar{y}_j)}{(n-1)}\\). In addition, in general, given a function \\(g(\\theta)\\) of the parameter \\(\\theta\\), if \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is a MLE of \\(\\theta\\), then \\(g(\\hat{\\theta})\\) is a MLE of \\(g(\\theta)\\).\n\r\rConditional Distribution of a Bivariate Normal\rConsider an indpendent and identically distributed sample formed by two variables \\(y=(y_1,y_2)\\), each measured on \\(i=1\\ldots,n\\) units, which come from a Bivariate Normal distribution with mean vector and covariance matrix\n\\[\r\\mu=(\\mu_1,\\mu_2) \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; \\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma^2_1 \u0026amp; \\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 \\\\ \\rho\\sigma_2\\sigma_1 \u0026amp; \\sigma_2^2 \\ \\end{pmatrix},\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho\\) is a correlation parameter between the two variables. Thus, intuitive MLEs for these parameters are\n\\[\r\\hat{\\mu}_j=\\bar{y}_j \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; \\hat{\\sigma}_{jk}=\\frac{(n-1)s_{jk}}{n},\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma^2_j=\\sigma_{jj}\\), \\(\\rho\\sigma_{j}\\sigma_{k}=\\sigma_{jk}\\), for \\(j,k=1,2\\). By properites of the Bivariate Normal distribution (Ord and Stuart (1994)), the marginal distribution of \\(y_1\\) and the conditional distribution of \\(y_2 \\mid y_1\\) are\n\\[\ry_1 \\sim \\text{Normal}\\left(\\mu_1,\\sigma^2_1 \\right) \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; y_2 \\mid y_1 \\sim \\text{Normal}\\left(\\mu_2 + \\beta(y_1-\\mu_1 \\right), \\sigma^2_2 - \\sigma^2_1\\beta^2),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta=\\rho\\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1}\\) is the parameter that quantifies the linear dependence between the two variables. The MLEs of \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma^2_2\\) can also be derived from the likelihood based on the conditional distribution of \\(y_2 \\mid y_1\\), which have strong connections with the least squares estimates derived in a multiple linear regression framework.\n\rMultiple Linear Regression\rSuppose the data consist in \\(n\\) units measured on an outcome variable \\(y\\) and a set of \\(J\\) covariates \\(x=(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{J})\\) and assume that the distribution of \\(y\\) given \\(x\\) is Normal with mean \\(\\mu_i=\\beta_0+\\sum_{j=1}^J\\beta_jx_{ij}\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). The loglikelihood of \\(\\theta=(\\beta,\\sigma^2)\\) given the observed data \\((y,x)\\) is given by\n\\[\rl(\\theta \\mid y) = -\\frac{n}{2}\\text{ln}(2\\pi) -\\frac{n}{2}\\text{ln}(\\sigma^2) - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\mu_i \\right)^2}{2\\sigma^2}.\r\\]\nMaximising this expression with respect to \\(\\theta\\), the MLEs are found to be equal to the least squares estimates of the intercept and regression coefficients. Using a matrix notation for the \\(n\\)-th vector of the outcome values \\(Y\\) and the \\(n\\times (J+1)\\) matrix of the covariate values (including the constant term), then the MLEs are:\n\\[\r\\hat{\\beta}=(X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}Y \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; \\hat{\\sigma}^{2}=\\frac{(Y-X\\hat{\\beta})(Y-X\\hat{\\beta})}{n},\r\\]\nwhere the numerator of the fraction is known as the Residual Sum of Squares(RSS). Because the denominator of is equal to \\(n\\), the MLE of \\(\\sigma^2\\) does not correct for the loss of degrees of freedom when estimating the \\(J+1\\) location parameters. Thus, the MLE should instead divide the RSS by \\(n-(J+1)\\) to obtain an unbiased estimator. An extension of standard multiple linear regression is the so called weighted multiple linear regression, in which the regression variance is assumed to be equal to\\(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{w_i}\\), for \\((w_i) \u0026gt; 0\\). Thus, the variable \\((y_i-\\mu)\\sqrt{w_i}\\) is Normally distributed with mean \\(0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), and the loglikelihood is\n\\[\rl(\\theta \\mid y)= - \\frac{n}{2}\\text{ln}(2\\pi) - \\frac{n}{2}\\text{ln}(\\sigma^2) - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i(y_i - \\mu_i)^2}{2\\sigma^2}.\r\\]\nMaximising this function yields MLEs given by the weighted least squares estimates\n\\[\r\\hat{\\beta}=\\left(X^{T}WX\\right)^{-1}\\left(X^{T}WY \\right) \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; \\sigma^{2}=\\frac{\\left(Y-X\\hat{\\beta}\\right)^{T}W\\left(Y-X\\hat{\\beta}\\right)}{n},\r\\]\nwhere \\(W=\\text{Diag}(w_1,\\ldots,w_n)\\).\n\rGeneralised Linear Models\rConsider the previous example where we had an outcome variable \\(y\\) and a set of \\(J\\) covariates, each measured on \\(n\\) units. A more general class of models, compare with the Normal model, assumes that, given \\(x\\), the values of \\(y\\) are an independent sample from a regular exponential family distribution\n\\[\rf(y \\mid x,\\beta,\\phi)=\\text{exp}\\left(\\frac{\\left(y\\delta\\left(x,\\beta \\right) - b\\left(\\delta\\left(x,\\beta\\right)\\right)\\right)}{\\phi} + c\\left(y,\\phi\\right)\\right),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\delta()\\) and \\(b()\\) are known functions that determine the distribution of \\(y\\), and \\(c()\\) is a known function indexed by a scale parameter \\(\\phi\\). The mean of \\(y\\) is assumed to linearly relate to the covariates via\n\\[\rE\\left[y \\mid x,\\beta,\\phi \\right]=g^{-1}\\left(\\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^J\\beta_jx_{j} \\right),\r\\]\nwhere \\(E\\left[y \\mid x,\\beta,\\phi \\right]=\\mu_i\\) and \\(g()\\) is a known one to one function which is called link function because it “links” the expectation of \\(y\\) to a linear combination of the covariates. The canonical link function\n\\[\rg_c(\\mu_i)=\\delta(x_{i},\\beta)=\\beta_0+\\sum_{j=1}^J\\beta_jx_{ij},\r\\]\nwhich is obtained by setting \\(g()\\) equal to the inverse of the derivative of \\(b()\\) with respect to its argument. Examples of canonical links include\n\rNormal linear regression: \\(g_c=\\text{identity}\\), \\(b(\\delta)=\\frac{\\delta^2}{2},\\phi=\\sigma^2\\)\n\rPoisson regression: \\(g_c=\\log\\), \\(b(\\delta)=\\text{exp}(\\delta),\\phi=1\\)\n\rLogistic regression: \\(g_c=\\text{logit}\\), \\(b(\\delta)=\\log(1+\\text{exp}(\\delta)),\\phi=1\\)\n\r\rThe loglikelihood of \\(\\theta=(\\beta,\\phi)\\) given the observed data \\((y,x)\\), is\n\\[\rl(\\theta \\mid y,x)=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[\\frac{\\left(y_i\\delta\\left(x_i,\\beta\\right)-b\\left(\\delta\\left(x_i,\\beta\\right)\\right) \\right)}{\\phi}+c\\left(y_i,\\phi\\right)\\right],\r\\]\nwhich for non-normal cases does not have explicit maxima and numerical maximisation can be achieved using iterative algorithms.\n\rReferences\rAnderson, Theodore Wilbur. 1962. “An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis.” Wiley New York.\n\rGelman, Andrew, John B Carlin, Hal S Stern, David B Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald B Rubin. 2013.

After incomplete cases are removed, the remaining complete cases can be weighted so that their distribution more closely resembles that of the full sample with respect to auxiliary variables. Weighting methods can eliminate bias due to differential response related to the variables used to model the response probabilities, but it cannot correct for biases related to variables that are unused or unmeasured (Little and Rubin (2019)). Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (1994) introduced Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) as a weighted regression approach that require an explicit model for the missingness but relaxes some of the parametric assumptions in the data model. Their method is an extension of Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), a popular technique for modeling marginal or populationaveraged relationships between a response variable and predictors (Zeger, Liang, and Albert (1988)).\nLet \\(y_i=(y_{i1},\\ldots,y_{iK})\\) denote a vector of variables for unit \\(i\\) subject to missing values with \\(y_i\\) being fully observed for \\(i=1\\ldots,n_r\\) units and partially-observed for \\(i=n_r+1,\\ldots,n\\) units. Define \\(m_i=1\\) if \\(y_i\\) is incomplete and \\(m_i=0\\) if complete. Let \\(x_i=(x_{i1},\\ldots,x_{ip})\\) denote a vector of fully observed covariates and suppose the interest is in estimating the mean of the distribution of \\(y_i\\) given \\(x_i\\), having the form \\(g(x_i,\\beta)\\), where \\(g()\\) is a possibly non-linear regression function indexed by a parameter \\(\\beta\\) of dimension \\(d\\). Let also \\(z_i=(z_{i1},\\ldots,z_{iq})\\) be a vector of fully observed auxiliary variables that potentially predictive of missingness but are not included in the model for \\(y_i \\mid x_i\\). When there are no missing data, a consistent estimate of \\(\\beta\\) is given by the solution to the following GEE, under mild regularity conditions (Liang and Zeger (1986)),\n\\[\r\\sum_{i=1}^n = D_i(x_i,\\beta)(y_i-g(x_i,\\beta))=0,\r\\]\nwhere \\(D_i(x_i,\\beta)\\) is a suitably chosen \\((d\\times k)\\) matrix of known functions of \\(x_i\\). With missing data, the equation is applied only to the complete cases (\\(n_{r}\\)), which yields consistent estimates provided that\n\\[\rp(m_i=1 \\mid x_i,y_i,z_i,\\phi)=p(m_i=1\\mid x_i,\\phi),\r\\]\nthat is, missingness does not depend on \\(y_i\\) or \\(z_i\\) after conditioning on \\(x_i\\). IPW GEE methods (Robins and Rotnitzky (1995)) replace the equation with\n\\[\r\\sum_{i=1}^{n_r} = w_i(\\hat{\\alpha})D_i(x_i,\\beta)(y_i-g(x_i,\\beta))=0,\r\\]\nwhere \\(w_i(\\hat{\\alpha})=\\frac{1}{p(x_i,z_i \\mid \\hat{\\alpha})}\\), with \\(p(x_i,z_i \\mid \\hat{\\alpha})\\) being an estimate of the probability of being a complete unit, obtained for example via logistic regressions on \\(m_i\\) on \\(x_i\\) and \\(z_i\\). If the logistic regression is correctly specified, IPW GEE yields a consistent estimator of \\(\\beta\\) provided that\n\\[\rp(m_i=1 \\mid x_i,y_i,z_i,\\phi)=p(m_i=1\\mid x_i,z_i\\phi).\r\\]\nExample\rSuppose the full data consists of a single outcome variable \\(y\\) and an additional variable \\(z\\) and that the objective is to estimate the population outcome mean \\(\\mu=\\text{E}[y]\\). If data were fully observed for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) individuals, an obvious estimator of \\(\\mu\\) would be the sample outcome mean\n\\[\r\\bar{y}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i,\r\\]\nwhich is equivalent to the solution to the estimating equation \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\mu)=0\\). When \\(y\\) is partially observed (while \\(Z\\) is always fully observed), individuals may fall into one of two missingness patterns \\(r=(r_{y},r_{z})\\), namely \\(r=(1,1)\\) if both variables are observed or \\(r=(1,0)\\) if \\(y\\) is missing. Let \\(c=1\\) if \\(r=(1,1)\\) and \\(c=0\\) otherwise, so that the observed data can be summarised as \\((c,cy,z)\\). Assuming that missingness only depends on \\(z\\), that is\n\\[\rp(c=1 \\mid y,z)=p(c=1 \\mid z)=\\pi(z),\r\\]\nthen the missing data mechanism is Missing At Random (MAR). Under these conditions, the sample mean of the complete cases \\(\\bar{y}_{cc}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^nc_iy_i}{c_i}\\), i.e. the solution to the equation \\(\\sum_{i=1}^nc_i(y_i-\\mu)=0\\), is not a consistent estimator of \\(\\mu\\). To correct for this, the IPW complete case estimating equation\n\\[\r\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{c_i}{\\pi(z_i)}(y_i-\\mu)=0,\r\\]\ncan be used to weight the contribution of each complete case by the inverse of \\(\\pi(z_i)\\). The solution of the equation corresponds to the IPW estimator\n\\[\r\\mu_{ipw}=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{c_i}{\\pi(z_i)} \\right)^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{c_iy_i}{\\pi(z_i)},\r\\]\nwhich is unbiased under MAR and for \\(\\pi(z)\u0026gt;0\\). In case you want to have a look at the proof of this I put here the link. In most situations \\(\\pi(z_i)\\) is not known and must be estimated from the data, typically posing some model for \\(p(c=1 \\mid z, \\hat{\\alpha})\\), indexed by some parameter \\(\\hat{\\alpha}\\), for example a logistic regression\n\\[\r\\text{logit}(\\pi)=\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1z.\r\\]\nOf course, if the model for \\(\\pi(z)\\) is misspecified, \\(\\mu_{ipw}\\) can be an inconsistent estimator. In addition, IPW methods typically used data only from the completers discarding all the partially observed values, which is clearly inefficient.\n\rConclusions\rThus, IPW estimators can correct for the bias of unweighted estimators due to the dependence of the missingness mechanism on \\(z_i\\) (Schafer and Graham (2002)). The basic intuition of IPW methods is that each subject’s contribution to the weighted Complete Case Analysis (CCA) is replicated \\(w_i\\) times in order to account once for herself and \\((1-w_i)\\) times for those subjects with the same responses and covariates who are missing. These models are called semiparametric because they apart from requiring the regression equation to have a specific form, they do not specify any probability distribution for the response variable (Molenberghs et al. (2014)). Older GEE methods can accommodate missing values only if they are Missing Completely At Random (MCAR), while more recent methods allow them to be MAR or even Missing Not At Random (MNAR), provided that a model for the missingness is correctly specified (Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (1995),Rotnitzky, Robins, and Scharfstein (1998)).\n\rReferences\rLiang, Kung-Yee, and Scott L Zeger. 1986. “Longitudinal Data Analysis Using Generalized Linear Models.” Biometrika 73 (1): 13–22.\n\rLittle, Roderick JA, and Donald B Rubin. 2019.

These are ordered in the sense that \\(H\\) completed data sets can be created from the sets of imputations, where the first imputed value replaces the missing value in the first completed data set, the second imputed value in the second completed data set, and so on. Next, standard complete data methods are used to analyse each completed data set. When the \\(H\\) sets of imputations are repeated random draws from the predictive distribution of the missing data under a particular model of missingness, the \\(H\\) completed data inferences can be combined to form one inference that properly reflects uncertainty due to missing values under that model. In general, MI procedures can be summarised in three main steps:\nSpecify an imputation model to generate \\(H\\) imputed values, typically taken as random draws from the predictive distribution of the missing values given the observed values, and create \\(H\\) completed data sets using these imputations and the observed data.\n\rAnalyse each completed data sets using standard complete data methods based on an analysis model, and derive \\(H\\) completed data inferences\n\rPool together the \\(H\\) completed data inferences into a single inference using standard MI formulas, which ensure that missing data uncertainty is taken into account\n\r\rMi was first proposed by Rubin (Rubin (1978)) and has become more popular over time (Rubin (1996), Schafer and Graham (2002), Little and Rubin (2019)), as well as the focus of research for methodological and practical applications in a variety of fields (Herzog and Rubin (1983), Rubin and Schenker (1987), Schafer (1999), Carpenter and Kenward (2012), Molenberghs et al. (2014), Van Buuren (2018)). MI shares both advantages of Single Imputaiton (SI) methods and solves both disadvantages. Indeed, like SI, MI methods allow the analyst to use familiar complete data methods when analysing the completed data sets. The only disadvantage of MI compared with SI methods is that it takes more time to generate the imputations and analyse the completed data sets. However, Rubin (2004) showed that in order to obtain sufficiently precise estimates, a relatively small number of imputations (typically \\(10\\)) is required. For example, considering a situation with \\(\\lambda=50\\%\\) missing information and \\(H=10\\) imputations, the efficiency of MI can be shown to be equal to \\((1+\\frac{\\lambda}{H})^{-1}=95\\%\\). In addition, in today’s computing environments, the work of analysing the completed data sets is quite modest since it involves performing the same task \\(H\\) times. Thus, once a precedure to combine multiple completed data sets is established, the additonal time and effort to handle \\(50\\), \\(20\\), or \\(10\\) imputations if often of little consequence.\nIn the first step of MI, imputations should ideally be created as repeated draws from the posterior predictive distribution of the missing values \\(y_{mis}\\) given the observed values \\(y_{obs}\\), each repetition being an independent drawing of the parameters and missing values. In practice, implicit imputation models can also be used in place of explicit imputation models (Herzog and Rubin (1983)). In the second step, each completed data set is analysed using the same complete data method that would be used in the absence of missingness. Finally, in the last step, standard procedures should be used to combine the compelted data inferences into a single one. The simplest and most popular method for combining the reuslts of \\(H\\) completed data sets is known as Rubin’s rules (Rubin (2004)), which can be explained with a simple example.\nRubin’s rules\rLet \\(\\hat{\\theta}_h\\) and \\(V_h\\), for \\(h=1,\\ldots,H\\), be the completed data estimates and sampling variances for a scalar estimand \\(\\theta\\), calculated from \\(H\\) repeated imputations under a given imputation model. Then, according to Rubin’s rules, the combined estimate is simply the average of the \\(H\\) completed data estimates, that is\n\\[\r\\bar{\\theta}_{H}=\\frac{1}{H}\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\hat{\\theta}_{h}.\r\\]\nBecause the imputations under MI are conditional draws, under a good imputaton model, they provide valid estimates for a wide range of estimands. In addition, the averaging over \\(H\\) imputed data sets increases the efficiency of estimation over that obtained from a single completed data set. The variability associated with the pooled estimate has two components: the average within-imputation variance \\(\\bar{V}_H\\) and the between-imputation variance \\(B_H\\), defined as\n\\[\r\\bar{V}_{H}=\\frac{1}{H}\\sum_{h=1}^{H}V_{h} \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; B_{H}=\\frac{1}{H-1}\\sum_{h=1}^{H}(\\hat{\\theta}_{h}-\\bar{\\theta}_{H})^2.\r\\]\nThe total variability associated with \\(\\bar{\\theta}_H\\) is the computed as\n\\[\rT_{H}=\\bar{V}_H + \\frac{H+1}{H}B_{H},\r\\]\nwhere \\((1+\\frac{1}{H})\\) is an adjustment factor for finite due to estimating \\(\\theta\\) by \\(\\bar{\\theta}_H\\). Thus, \\(\\hat{\\lambda}_H=(1+\\frac{1}{H})\\frac{B_H}{T_H}\\) is known as the fraction of missing information and is an estimate of the fraction of information about \\(\\theta\\) that is missing due to nonresponse. For large sample sizes and scalar quantities like \\(\\theta\\), the reference distribution for interval estimates and significance tests is a \\(t\\) distribution\n\\[\r(\\theta - \\bar{\\theta}_H)\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T^2_H}} \\sim t_v,\r\\]\nwhere the degrees of freedom \\(v\\) can be approximated with the quantity \\(v=(H-1)\\left(1+\\frac{1}{H+1}\\frac{\\bar{V}_H}{B_H} \\right)^2\\) (Rubin and Schenker (1987)). In small data sets, an improved version of \\(v\\) can be obtained as \\(v^\\star=(\\frac{1}{v}+\\frac{1}{\\hat{v}_{obs}})^{-1}\\), where\n\\[\r\\hat{v}_{obs}=(1-\\hat{\\lambda}_{H})\\left(\\frac{v_{com}+1}{v_{com}+3}\\right)v_{com},\r\\]\nwith \\(v_{com}\\) being the degrees of freedom for appropriate or exact \\(t\\) inferences about \\(\\theta\\) when there are no missing values (Barnard and Rubin (1999)).\nThe validity of MI rests on how the imputations are created and how that procedure relates to the model used to subsequently analyze the data. Creating MIs often requires special algorithms (Schafer (1997)). In general, they should be drawn from a distribution for the missing data that reflects uncertainty about the parameters of the data model. Recall that with SI methods, it is desirable to impute from the conditional distribution \\(p(y_{mis}\\mid y_{obs},\\hat{\\theta})\\), where \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is an estimate derived from the observed data. MI extends this approach by first simulating \\(H\\) independent plausible values for the parameters \\(\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_H\\) and then drawing the missing values \\(y_{mis}^h\\) from \\(p(y_{mis}\\mid y_{obs}, \\theta_h)\\). Treating parameters as random rather than fixed is\ran essential part of MI. For this reason, it is natural (but not essential) to motivate MI from the Bayesian perspective, in which the state of knowledge about parameters is represented through a posterior distribution.\n\rJoint Multiple Imputation\rJoint MI starts from the assumption that the data can be described by a multivariate distribution which in many cases, mostly for practical reasons, corresponds to assuming a multivariate Normal distribution. The general idea is that, for a general missing data pattern $ r$, missingness may occur anywhere in the multivariate outcome vector $ y=(y_1,,y_J)$, so that the distribution from which imputations should be drawn varies based on the observed variables in each pattern. For example, given $ r=(0,0,1,1)$, then imputations should be drawn from the bivariate distribution of the missing variables given the observed variables in that pattern, that is from \\(f(y^{mis}_1,y^{mis}_2 \\mid y^{obs}_3, y^{obs}_4, \\phi_{12})\\), where \\(\\phi_{12}\\) is the probability of being in pattern $ r$ where the first two variables are missing.\nConsider the multivariate Normal distribution \\(y \\sim N(\\mu,\\Sigma)\\), where \\(\\theta=(\\mu,\\Sigma)\\) represent the vector of the parameters of interest which need to be identified. Indeed, for non-monotone missing data, $ $ cannot be generally identified based on the observed data directly $ y^{obs}$, and the typical solution is to iterate imputation and parameter estimation using a general algorithm known as data augmentation(Tanner and Wong (1987)). Following Van Buuren (2018), the general procedure of the algorithm can be summarised as follows:\nDefine some plausible starting values for all parameters \\(\\theta_0=(\\mu_0,\\Sigma_0)\\)\n\rAt each iteration \\(t=1,\\ldots,T\\), draw \\(h=1,\\ldots,H\\) imputations for each missing value from the predictive distribution of the missing data given the observed data and the current value of the parameters at \\(t-1\\), that is\n\r\r\\[\r\\hat{y}^{mis}_{t} \\sim p(y^{mis} \\mid y^{obs},\\theta_{t-1})\r\\]\nRe-estimate the parameters \\(\\theta\\) using the observed and imputed data at \\(t\\) based on the multivariate Normal model, that is\r\r\\[\r\\hat{\\theta}_{t} \\sim p(\\theta \\mid y^{obs}, \\hat{y}^{mis}_{t})\r\\]\nAnd reiterate the steps 2 and 3 until convergence, where the stopping rule typically consists in imposing that the change in the parameters between iterations \\(t-1\\) and \\(t\\) should be smaller than a predefined “small” threshold \\(\\epsilon\\). Schafer (1997) showed that imputations generated under the multivariate Normal model can be robust to non-normal data, even though it is generally more efficient to transform the data towards normality, especially when the parameters of interest are difficult to estimate, such as quantiles and variances.\nThe multivariate Normal model is also often applied to categorical data, with different types of specifications that have been proposed in the literature (Schafer (1997),Horton, Lipsitz, and Parzen (2003),Allison (2005),Bernaards, Belin, and Schafer (2007),Yucel, He, and Zaslavsky (2008),Demirtas (2009)). For examples, missing data in contingency tables can be imputed using log-linear models (Schafer (1997)); mixed continuous-categorical data can be imputed under the general location model which combines a log-linear and multivariate Normal model (Olkin, Tate, and others (1961)); two-way imputation can be applied to missing test item responses by imputing missing categorical data by conditioning on the row and column sum scores of the multivariate data (Van Ginkel et al. (2007)).\n\rReferences\rAllison, Paul D. 2005. “Imputation of Categorical Variables with Proc Mi.” SUGI 30 Proceedings 113 (30): 1–14.\n\rBarnard, John, and Donald B Rubin. 1999. “Miscellanea.

However, asymptotic standard errors obtained from the information matrix, are more questionable when dealing with missing data since the sample will not be typically iid and results that imply the large sample normality of the likelihood function do not immediately apply. More complications arise when dealing with the process that lead to some of the data to be missing. This can be explained with a simple example.\nLet \\(Y=(y_{ij})\\), for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) and \\(j=1,\\ldots,J\\), denote the complete dataset if there were no missing values, with a total of \\(n\\) units and \\(J\\) variables. Let \\(M=(m_{ij})\\) denote the fully observed matrix of binary missing data indicators with \\(m_{ij}=1\\) if \\(y_{ij}\\) is missing and \\(0\\) otherwise. As an example, we can model the density of the joint distribution of \\(Y\\) and \\(M\\) using the selection model factorisation (Little and Rubin (2019))\n\\[\rp(Y=y,M=m \\mid \\theta, \\psi) = f(y \\mid \\theta)f(m \\mid y, \\psi),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is the parameter vector indexing the response model and \\(\\psi\\) is the parameter vector indexing the missingness mechanism. The observed values \\(m\\) effect a partition \\(y=(y_1,y_0)\\), where \\(y_0=[y_{ij} : m_{ij}=0]\\) is the observed component and \\(y_1=[y_{ij} : m_{ij}=1]\\) is the missing component of \\(y\\). The full likelihood based on the observed data and the assumed model is\n\\[\rL_{full}(\\theta, \\psi \\mid y_{0},m) = \\int f\\left(y_{0},y_{1} \\mid \\theta \\right) f\\left(m \\mid y_{0},y_{1}, \\psi \\right)dy_{1}\r\\]\nand is a function of the parameters \\((\\theta,\\psi)\\). Next, we define the likelihood of ignoring the missingness mechanism or ignorable likelihood as\n\\[\rL_{ign}\\left(\\theta \\mid y_{0} \\right) = \\int f(y_{0},y_{1}\\mid \\theta)dy_{1},\r\\]\nwhich does not involve the model for \\(M\\). In practice, modelling the joint distribution of \\(Y\\) and \\(M\\) is often challenging and, in fact, many approaches to missing data do not model \\(M\\) and (explicitly or implicitly) base inference about \\(\\theta\\) on the ignorable likelihood. It is therefore important to assess under which conditions inferences about \\(\\theta\\) based on \\(L_{ign}\\) can be considered appropriate. More specifically, the missingness mechanism is said to be ignorable if inferences about \\(\\theta\\) based on the ignorable likelihood equation evauluated at some realisations of \\(y_0\\) and \\(m\\) are the same as inferences about \\(\\theta\\) based on the full likelihood equation, evaluated at the same realisations of \\(y_0\\) and \\(m\\). The conditions for ignoring the missingness mechanism depend on whether the inferences are direct likelihood, Bayesian or frequentist.\nDirect Likelihood Inference\rDirect Likelihood Inference refers to inference based solely on likelihood ratios for pair of values of the parameters, with the data fixed at their observed values. The missingness mechanism can be ignored for direct likelihood if the likelihood ratio based on the ignorable likelihood is the same as the ratio based on the full likelihood. More precisely, the missingness mechanism is said to be ignorable for direct likelihood inference at some realisations of \\((y_0,m)\\) if the likelihood ratio for two values \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\theta^\\star\\) is the same whether based on the full or ignorable likelihood. That is\n\\[\r\\frac{L_{full}\\left( \\theta, \\psi \\mid y_{0}, m \\right)}{L_{full}\\left( \\theta^{\\star}, \\psi \\mid y_{0}, m \\right)}=\\frac{L_{ign}\\left( \\theta \\mid y_{0} \\right)}{L_{ign}\\left( \\theta^{\\star} \\mid y_{0}\\right)},\r\\]\nfor all \\(\\theta\\), \\(\\theta^\\star\\) and \\(\\psi\\). In general, the missingnes mechanism is ignorable for direct likelihood inference if the following two conditions hold:\nParameter distinctness. The parameters \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are distinct, in the sense that the joint parameter space \\(\\Omega_{\\theta,\\psi}\\) is the product of the two parameter spaces \\(\\Omega_{\\theta}\\) and \\(\\Omega_{\\psi}\\).\rFactorisation of the full likelihood. The full likelihood factors as\r\r\\[\rL_{full}\\left(\\theta, \\psi \\mid y_{0},m \\right) = L_{ign}\\left(\\theta \\mid y_{0} \\right) L_{rest}\\left(\\psi \\mid y_{0},m \\right)\r\\]\nfor all values of \\(\\theta,\\psi \\in \\Omega_{\\theta,\\psi}\\). The distinctness condition ensures that each value of \\(\\psi \\in \\Omega_{\\psi}\\) is compatible with different values of \\(\\theta \\in \\Omega_{\\theta}\\). A sufficient condition for the factorisation of the full likelihood is that the missing data are Missing At Random(MAR) at the specific realisations of \\(y_{0},m\\). This means that the distribution function of \\(M\\), evaluated at the given realisations \\((y_{0},m)\\), does not depend on the missing values \\(y_1\\), that is\n\\[\rf\\left(m \\mid y_{0}, y_{1}, \\psi \\right)=f\\left(m \\mid y_{0}, y^{\\star}_{1} \\psi \\right),\r\\]\nfor all \\(y_{1},y^\\star_{1},\\psi\\). Thus, we have\n\\[\rf\\left(y_{0}, m \\mid \\theta, \\psi \\right) = f\\left(m \\mid y_{0}, \\psi \\right) \\int f\\left(y_{0},y_{1} \\mid \\theta \\right)dy_{1} = f\\left(m \\mid y_{0}, \\psi \\right) f\\left( y_{0} \\mid \\theta \\right).\r\\]\nFrom this it follows that, if the missing data are MAR at the given realisations of \\((y_{0},m)\\) and \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are distinct, the missingnes mechanism is ignorable for likelihood inference.\n\rBayesian Inference\rBayesian Inference under the full model for \\(Y\\) and \\(M\\) requires that the full likelihood is combined with a prior distribution \\(p(\\theta,\\psi)\\) for the parameters \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\psi\\), that is\n\\[\rp\\left(\\theta, \\psi \\mid y_{0}, m \\right) \\propto p(\\theta, \\psi) L_{full}\\left(\\theta, \\psi \\mid y_{0}, m \\right).\r\\]\nBayesian inference ignoring the missingness mechanism combines the ignorable likelihood with a prior distribution for \\(\\theta\\) alone, that is\n\\[\rp(\\theta \\mid y_{0}) \\propto p(\\theta) L_{ign}\\left(\\theta \\mid y_{0} \\right).\r\\]\nMore formally, the missingness mechanism is said to be ignorable for Bayesian inference at the given realisations of \\((y_{0},m)\\) if the posterior distribution for \\(\\theta\\) based on the posterior distribution for the full likelihood and prior distribution for \\((\\theta,\\psi)\\) is the same as the posterior distribution for the ignorable likelihood and the prior distribution for \\(\\theta\\) alone. This holds when the following conditions are satisfied:\nThe parameters \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are a priori independent, that is the prior distribution has the form\r\r\\[\rp(\\theta , \\psi) = p(\\theta) p(\\psi)\r\\]\nThe full likelihood evaluated at the realisations of \\((y_{0},m)\\) factors as for direct likelihood inference\r\rUnder these conditions:\n\\[\rp(\\theta, \\psi \\mid y_{0}, m) \\propto \\left(p(\\theta)L_{ign}\\left( \\theta \\mid y_{0} \\right) \\right) \\left(p(\\psi)L_{rest}\\left(\\psi \\mid y_{0},m \\right) \\right).\r\\]\nAs for direct likelihood inference, MAR is a sufficient condition for the factorisation of the full likelihood. This means that, if the data are MAR at the given realisations of \\((y_{0},m)\\) and the parameters \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are a prior independent, then the missingness mechanism is ignorable for Bayesian inference. We note that the a priori condition is more stringent than the distinctness condition because paramerers with distinct parameter spaces might have dependent prior distributions.\n\rFrequentist Asymptotic Inference\rFrequentist Asymptotic Inference requires that, in order to ignore the missingness mechanism, the factorisation of the full likelihood needs to be valid for values of the observed data under repeated sampling. This means that we require\n\\[\rL_{full}\\left(\\theta,\\psi \\mid y_{0}, m \\right) = L_{ign}\\left(\\theta \\mid y_{0} \\right) L_{rest}\\left(\\psi \\mid y_{0}, m \\right)\r\\]\nfor all \\(y_{0},m\\) and \\(\\theta,\\psi \\in \\Omega_{\\theta,\\psi}\\). For this form of inference, a sufficient condition for ignoring the missingness mechanism is given by the following conditions:\nParameter distinctness as defined for direct likelihood inference.\n\rMissing data are Missing Always At Random (MAAR), that is\n\r\r\\[\rf\\left(m \\mid y_{0},y_{1},\\psi \\right) = f\\left(m \\mid y_{0}, y^{\\star}_{1},\\psi \\right)\r\\]\nfor all \\(m,y_{0},y_{1},y^\\star_{1},\\psi\\). In the following example we discuss conditions for ignoring the missingness mechanism for direct likelihood and Bayesian inference, which can be extended to the case of frequentist asymptotic inference by requiring that they hold for for values of \\(y_{0},m\\) other than those observed that could arise in repeated sampling.\n\rBivariate Normal Sample with One Variable Subject to Missingness\rConsider a bivariate normal sample \\(y=(y_{i1},y_{i2})\\), for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) units, but with the values of \\(y_{i2}\\) being missing for \\(i=(n_{cc}+1),\\ldots,n\\). This leads to a monotone missing data pattern with two variables. The loglikelihood of ignoring the missingness mechanism is\n\\[\rl_{ign}\\left(\\mu, \\Sigma \\mid y_{0} \\right) = \\log\\left(L_{ign}\\left(\\mu,\\Sigma \\mid y_{0} \\right) \\right) = - \\frac{1}{2}n_{cc}ln \\mid \\Sigma \\mid - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{cc}}(y_i - \\mu ) \\Sigma^{-1}(y_i - \\mu)^{T} - \\frac{1}{2}(n-n_{cc})ln\\sigma_{1} - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=n_{cc}+1}^{n}\\frac{(y_{i1}-\\mu_1)^2}{\\sigma_{1}}.\r\\]\nThis loglikelihood is appropriate for inference provided the conditional distribution of \\(M\\) does not depend on the values of \\(y_{i2}\\), and \\(\\theta=(\\mu,\\Sigma)\\) is distinct from \\(\\psi\\). Under these conditions, ML estimates of \\(\\theta\\) can be found by maximising this loglikelihood. For Bayesian inference, if these conditions hold and the prior distribution for \\((\\theta,\\psi)\\) has the form \\(p(\\theta)p(\\psi)\\), then the joint posterior distribution of \\(\\theta\\) is proportional to the product of \\(p(\\theta)\\) and \\(L_{ign}(\\theta \\mid y_{0})\\).\n\rReferences\rLittle, Roderick JA, and Donald B Rubin. 2019.

Here we focus our attention on the situations where the missingness mechanism is Missing Not At Random(MNAR) and valid Maximum Likelihood(ML), Bayesian and Multiple Imputation(MI) inferences generally need to be based on the full likelihood\n\\[\rL_{full}\\left(\\theta, \\psi \\mid Y_0, X, M \\right) \\propto f\\left(Y_0, M \\mid X, \\theta, \\psi \\right),\r\\]\nregarded as a function of \\((\\theta,\\psi)\\) for fixed \\((Y_0,M)\\). Here, \\(f(Y_0,M\\mid \\theta, \\psi)\\) is obtained by integrating out \\(Y_1\\) from the joint density \\(f(Y,M \\mid X, \\theta, \\psi)\\). Two main approaches for formulating MNAR models can be distinguished, namely selection models(SM) and pattern mixture models(PMM).\nSelection and Pattern Mixture Models\rSMs factor the joint distribution of \\(m_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) as\n\\[\rf(m_i,y_i \\mid x_i, \\theta, \\psi) = f(y_i \\mid x_i, \\theta)f(m_i \\mid x_i,y_i,\\psi),\r\\]\nwhere the first factor is the distribution of \\(y_i\\) in the population while the second factor is the missingness mechanism, with \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\psi\\) which are assumed to be distinct. Alternatively, PMMs factor the joint distribution as\n\\[\rf(m_i,y_i \\mid x_i, \\theta, \\psi) = f(y_i \\mid x_i, m_i,\\xi)f(m_i \\mid x_i),\r\\]\nwhere the first factor is the distribution of \\(y_i\\) in the strata defined by different patterns of missingness \\(m_i\\) while the second factor models the probabilities of the different patterns, with \\(\\xi\\) which are assumed to be distinct (Little (1993),Little and Rubin (2019)). The distinction between the two factorisations becomes clearer when considering a specific example.\nSuppose thta missing values are confined to a single variable and let \\(y_i=(y_{i,1},y_{i2})\\) be a bivariate response outcome where \\(y_{i1}\\) is fully observed and \\(y_{i2}\\) is observed for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n_{cc}\\) but missing for \\(i=n_{cc}+1,\\ldots,n\\). Let \\(m_{i2}\\) be the missingness indicator for \\(y_{i2}\\), then a PMM factors the denisty of \\(Y_0\\) and \\(M\\) given \\(X\\) as\n\\[\rf(y_0, M \\mid X, \\xi)=\\prod_{i=1}^{n_{cc}}f(y_{i1},y_{i2}\\mid x_i, m_{i2}=0,\\xi)Pr(m_{i2}=0 \\mid x_i, \\omega) \\times \\prod_{i=n_{cc}+1}^{n}f(y_{i1} \\mid x_i, m_{i2}=1,\\xi)Pr(m_{i2}=1 \\mid x_i, \\omega).\r\\]\nThis expression shows that there are no data with which to estimate directly the distribution \\(f(y_{i2} \\mid x_i, m_{i2}=1,\\xi)\\), because all units with \\(m_{i2}=1\\) have \\(y_{i2}\\) missing. Under MAR, this is identified using the distribution of the observed data \\(f(y_{i2} \\mid x_i, m_{i2}=1,\\xi)=f(y_{i2} \\mid x_i, m_{i2}=0,\\xi)\\), while under MNAR it must be identified using other assumptions. The SM formulation is\n\\[\rf(y_i, m_{i2} \\mid \\theta, \\psi) = f(y_{i1} \\mid x_i, \\theta)f(y_{i2} \\mid x_i, y_{i1},\\theta)f(m_{i2}\\mid x_i,y_{i1},y_{i2},\\psi).\r\\]\nTypically, the missingness mechanism \\(f(m_{i2} \\mid x_i,y_{i1},y_{i2},\\psi)\\) is modelled using some additive probit or logit regression of \\(m_{i2}\\) on \\(x_i\\),\\(y_{i1}\\) and \\(y_{i2}\\). However, the coefficient of \\(y_{i2}\\) in this regression is not directly estimable from the data and hence the model cannot be fully estimated without extra assumptions.\nNormal Models for MNAR data\rAssume we have a complete sample \\((y_i,x_i)\\) on a continuous variable \\(Y\\) and a set of fully observed covariates \\(X\\), for \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\). Suppose that \\(i=1,\\ldots,n_{cc}\\) units are observed while the remaining \\(i=n_{cc}+1,\\ldots,n\\) units are missing, with \\(m_i\\) being the corresponding missingness indicator. Heckman (Heckman (1976)) proposed the following selection model to handle missingness:\n\\[\ry_i \\mid x_i, \\theta, \\psi \\sim N(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_i, \\sigma^2) \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; m_i \\mid x_i,y_i,\\theta,\\psi \\sim Bern\\left(\\Phi(\\psi_0 + \\psi_1x_i + \\psi_2y_i) \\right),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta=(\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\sigma^2)\\) and \\(\\Phi\\) denotes the probit (cumulative normal) distribution function. Note that if \\(\\psi_2=0\\), the missing data are MAR, while if \\(\\psi_2 \\neq 0\\) the missing data are MNAR since missingness in \\(Y\\) depends on the unobserved value of \\(Y\\). This model can be estimated using either a two-step least squares method, ML in combination with an EM algorithm, or a Bayesian approach. The main issue is the lack of information about \\(\\psi_2\\), which can be partly identified through the specific assumptions about the distribution of the observed data of \\(Y\\). This, however, makes the implicit assumption that the assumed distribution can well described the distribution of the complete (observed and missing) data which can never be tested or checked. An alternative approach is to use a PMM factorisation and model:\n\\[\ry_i \\mid m_i=m,x_i,\\xi,\\omega \\sim N(\\beta_0^m + \\beta_1^mx_i, \\sigma^{2m})\\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; m_i \\mid x_i,\\xi,\\omega \\sim Bern\\left(\\Phi(\\omega_0 + \\omega_1x_i) \\right),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\xi=(\\beta_0^m,\\beta_1^m,\\sigma^{2m},\\;\\;\\; m=0,1)\\). This model implies that the distribution of \\(y_i\\) given \\(x_i\\) in the population is a mixture of two normal distributions with mean\n\\[\r\\left[1 - \\Phi(\\omega_0 + \\omega_1x_i) \\right] \\left[\\beta_0^0 + \\beta_1^0 x_i \\right] + \\left[\\Phi(\\omega_0 + \\omega_1x_i) \\right] \\left[\\beta_0^1 + \\beta_1^1 x_i \\right].\r\\]\nThe parameters \\((\\beta_0^0,\\beta_1^0,\\sigma^{20},\\omega)\\) can be estimated from the data but the parameters \\((\\beta_0^1,\\beta_1^1,\\sigma^{21})\\) are not estimable because \\(y_i\\) is missing when \\(m_i=1\\). Under MAR, the distribution of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\) is the same for units with \\(Y\\) observed and missing, such that \\(\\beta_0^0=\\beta_0^1=\\beta_0\\) (as well as for \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\)). Under MNAR, other assumptions are needed to esitmate the parameters indexed by \\(m=1\\).\nSome final considerations:\n\rBoth SM and PMM model the joint distribution of \\(Y\\) and \\(M\\).\n\rThe SM formulation is more natural when the substantive interest concerns the relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) in the population. However, these parameters can also be derived in PMM by averaging the patterns specific parameters over the missingness patterns.\n\rThe PMM factorisation is more transparent in terms of the underlying assumptions about the unidentified parameters of the model, while SM tends to impose some obscure constraints in order to identify these parameters, which are also difficult to interpret.\n\rGiven specific assumptions to identify all the parameters in the model, PMMs are often easier to fit than SMs. In addition, imputations of the missing values are based on the predictive distribution of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\) and \\(M=0\\).\n\r\rThese considerations seem to favour PMM over SM as MNAR approaches, especially when considering sensitivity analysis. Bayesian approaches can also be used to identify these models, by assigning prior distributions which can be used to identify those parameters which cannot be estimated from the data. Justifications for the choice of these priors are therefore necessary to ensure the plausibility of the assumptions assessed and the impact of these assumptions on the posterior inference.\n\r\rReferences\rHeckman, James J. 1976. “The Common Structure of Statistical Models of Truncation, Sample Selection and Limited Dependent Variables and a Simple Estimator for Such Models.” In Annals of Economic and Social Measurement, Volume 5, Number 4, 475–92.

These are ordered in the sense that \\(H\\) completed data sets can be created from the sets of imputations, where the first imputed value replaces the missing value in the first completed data set, the second imputed value in the second completed data set, and so on. Next, standard complete data methods are used to analyse each completed data set. When the \\(H\\) sets of imputations are repeated random draws from the predictive distribution of the missing data under a particular model of missingness, the \\(H\\) completed data inferences can be combined to form one inference that properly reflects uncertainty due to missing values under that model. In general, MI procedures can be summarised in three main steps:\nSpecify an imputation model to generate \\(H\\) imputed values, typically taken as random draws from the predictive distribution of the missing values given the observed values, and create \\(H\\) completed data sets using these imputations and the observed data.\n\rAnalyse each completed data sets using standard complete data methods based on an analysis model, and derive \\(H\\) completed data inferences\n\rPool together the \\(H\\) completed data inferences into a single inference using standard MI formulas, which ensure that missing data uncertainty is taken into account\n\r\rMi was first proposed by Rubin (Rubin (1978)) and has become more popular over time (Rubin (1996), Schafer and Graham (2002), Little and Rubin (2019)), as well as the focus of research for methodological and practical applications in a variety of fields (Herzog and Rubin (1983), Rubin and Schenker (1987), Schafer (1999), Carpenter and Kenward (2012), Molenberghs et al. (2014), Van Buuren (2018)). MI shares both advantages of Single Imputaiton (SI) methods and solves both disadvantages. Indeed, like SI, MI methods allow the analyst to use familiar complete data methods when analysing the completed data sets. The only disadvantage of MI compared with SI methods is that it takes more time to generate the imputations and analyse the completed data sets. However, Rubin (2004) showed that in order to obtain sufficiently precise estimates, a relatively small number of imputations (typically \\(10\\)) is required. For example, considering a situation with \\(\\lambda=50\\%\\) missing information and \\(H=10\\) imputations, the efficiency of MI can be shown to be equal to \\((1+\\frac{\\lambda}{H})^{-1}=95\\%\\). In addition, in today’s computing environments, the work of analysing the completed data sets is quite modest since it involves performing the same task \\(H\\) times. Thus, once a precedure to combine multiple completed data sets is established, the additonal time and effort to handle \\(50\\), \\(20\\), or \\(10\\) imputations if often of little consequence.\nIn the first step of MI, imputations should ideally be created as repeated draws from the posterior predictive distribution of the missing values \\(y_{mis}\\) given the observed values \\(y_{obs}\\), each repetition being an independent drawing of the parameters and missing values. In practice, implicit imputation models can also be used in place of explicit imputation models (Herzog and Rubin (1983)). In the second step, each completed data set is analysed using the same complete data method that would be used in the absence of missingness. Finally, in the last step, standard procedures should be used to combine the compelted data inferences into a single one. The simplest and most popular method for combining the reuslts of \\(H\\) completed data sets is known as Rubin’s rules (Rubin (2004)), which can be explained with a simple example.\nRubin’s rules\rLet \\(\\hat{\\theta}_h\\) and \\(V_h\\), for \\(h=1,\\ldots,H\\), be the completed data estimates and sampling variances for a scalar estimand \\(\\theta\\), calculated from \\(H\\) repeated imputations under a given imputation model. Then, according to Rubin’s rules, the combined estimate is simply the average of the \\(H\\) completed data estimates, that is\n\\[\r\\bar{\\theta}_{H}=\\frac{1}{H}\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\hat{\\theta}_{h}.\r\\]\nBecause the imputations under MI are conditional draws, under a good imputaton model, they provide valid estimates for a wide range of estimands. In addition, the averaging over \\(H\\) imputed data sets increases the efficiency of estimation over that obtained from a single completed data set. The variability associated with the pooled estimate has two components: the average within-imputation variance \\(\\bar{V}_H\\) and the between-imputation variance \\(B_H\\), defined as\n\\[\r\\bar{V}_{H}=\\frac{1}{H}\\sum_{h=1}^{H}V_{h} \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; B_{H}=\\frac{1}{H-1}\\sum_{h=1}^{H}(\\hat{\\theta}_{h}-\\bar{\\theta}_{H})^2.\r\\]\nThe total variability associated with \\(\\bar{\\theta}_H\\) is the computed as\n\\[\rT_{H}=\\bar{V}_H + \\frac{H+1}{H}B_{H},\r\\]\nwhere \\((1+\\frac{1}{H})\\) is an adjustment factor for finite due to estimating \\(\\theta\\) by \\(\\bar{\\theta}_H\\). Thus, \\(\\hat{\\lambda}_H=(1+\\frac{1}{H})\\frac{B_H}{T_H}\\) is known as the fraction of missing information and is an estimate of the fraction of information about \\(\\theta\\) that is missing due to nonresponse. For large sample sizes and scalar quantities like \\(\\theta\\), the reference distribution for interval estimates and significance tests is a \\(t\\) distribution\n\\[\r(\\theta - \\bar{\\theta}_H)\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T^2_H}} \\sim t_v,\r\\]\nwhere the degrees of freedom \\(v\\) can be approximated with the quantity \\(v=(H-1)\\left(1+\\frac{1}{H+1}\\frac{\\bar{V}_H}{B_H} \\right)^2\\) (Rubin and Schenker (1987)). In small data sets, an improved version of \\(v\\) can be obtained as \\(v^\\star=(\\frac{1}{v}+\\frac{1}{\\hat{v}_{obs}})^{-1}\\), where\n\\[\r\\hat{v}_{obs}=(1-\\hat{\\lambda}_{H})\\left(\\frac{v_{com}+1}{v_{com}+3}\\right)v_{com},\r\\]\nwith \\(v_{com}\\) being the degrees of freedom for appropriate or exact \\(t\\) inferences about \\(\\theta\\) when there are no missing values (Barnard and Rubin (1999)).\nThe validity of MI rests on how the imputations are created and how that procedure relates to the model used to subsequently analyze the data. Creating MIs often requires special algorithms (Schafer (1997)). In general, they should be drawn from a distribution for the missing data that reflects uncertainty about the parameters of the data model. Recall that with SI methods, it is desirable to impute from the conditional distribution \\(p(y_{mis}\\mid y_{obs},\\hat{\\theta})\\), where \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is an estimate derived from the observed data. MI extends this approach by first simulating \\(H\\) independent plausible values for the parameters \\(\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_H\\) and then drawing the missing values \\(y_{mis}^h\\) from \\(p(y_{mis}\\mid y_{obs}, \\theta_h)\\). Treating parameters as random rather than fixed is\ran essential part of MI. For this reason, it is natural (but not essential) to motivate MI from the Bayesian perspective, in which the state of knowledge about parameters is represented through a posterior distribution.\n\rMultiple Imputation by Chained Equations\rMI by Chained Equations, also known as Fully Conditional Specification(FCS), imputes multivariate missing data on a variable-by-variable basis, and therefore requires the specification of an imputation model for each incomplete variable to create imputations per variable in an iterative fashion (Van Buuren (2007)). In contrast to Joint MI, MICE specifies the multivariate distribution for the outcome and missingness pattern \\(p(y,r\\mid \\theta, \\phi)\\), indexed by the parameter vectors of the outcome (\\(\\theta\\)) and missingness models (\\(\\phi\\)), through a set of conditional densities \\(p(y_j \\mid y_{-j},r,\\theta_j, \\phi_j)\\), which is used to impute \\(y_j\\) given the other variables. Starting from a random draw from the marginal distribution of \\(y_1\\), imputation is then carried out by iterating over the conditionally specified imputation models for each \\(y_j=(y_2,\\ldots,y_J)\\) separately given the set of all the other variables \\(y_{-j}\\).\nTha main idea of MICE is to directly draw the missing data from the predictive distribution of conditional densities, therefore avoiding the need to specify a joint multivariate model for all the data. Different approaches can be used to implement MICE. For example, a possible strategy is the following:\nStart at iteration \\(t=0\\) by drawing randomly from the the distribution of the missing data given the observed data and all other variables, according to some probability model for each variable \\(y_j\\), that is\r\r\\[\r\\hat{y}^{mis}_{j,0} \\sim p(y^{mis}_{j} \\mid y^{obs}_{j}, y_{-j}, r)\r\\]\nAt each iteration \\(t=1,\\ldots,T\\) and for each variable \\(j=\\ldots,J\\), set\r\r\\[\r\\hat{y}^{mis}_{-j,t}=\\left(\\hat{y}_{1,t},\\ldots, \\hat{y}_{j-1,t}, \\hat{y}_{j+1,t}, \\ldots, \\hat{y}_{J,t} \\right)\r\\]\nas the currently completed data except \\(y_j\\)\nDraw \\(h=1,\\ldots,H\\) imputations for each variable \\(y_j\\) from the predictive distribution of the missing data given the observed data and the currently imputed data at \\(t\\), that is\r\r\\[\r\\hat{y}^{mis}_{j,t} \\sim p(y^{mis}_{j} \\mid y^{obs}_{j}, \\hat{y}_{-j,t}, r)\r\\]\nand repeat the steps 2 and 3 until convergence. It is important to stress out that MICE is essentially a Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) algorithm (Brooks et al. (2011)), where the state space is the collection of all imputed values. More specifically, when the conditional distributions of all variables are compatible with a joint multivariate distribution, the algorithm corresponds to a Gibbs sampler, a Bayesian simulation method that samples from the conditional distributions in order to obtain samples from the joint multivariate distribution of all variables via some conditional factorisation of the latter (Casella and George (1992), Gilks, Richardson, and Spiegelhalter (1996)). A potential issue of MICE is that, since the conditional distributions are specified freely by the user, these may not be compatible with a joint distribution and therefore it is not clear from which distribution the algorithm is sampling from. However, a general advatage of MICE is that it gives freedom to the user for the specification of the univariate models for the variables, which can be tailored to handle different types of variabes (e.g. continuous and categorical) and different statistical issues for each variable (e.g. skewness and non-liner associations).\nRegardless of the theoretical implications of MICE, as a MCMC method, the algorithm converges to a stationary distribution when three conditions are satisfied (Roberts (1996),Brooks et al. (2011)):\n\rThe chain is irreducible, i.e. must be able to reach any state from any state in the state space\n\rThe chain is aperiodic, i.e. must be able to return to each state after some unknown number of steps or transitions\n\rThe chain is recurrent, i.e. there is probability of one of eventually returning to each state after some number of steps\n\r\rTypically periodicity and non-recurrence can be a problem in MICE when the imputation models are not compatible, possibly leading to different inferences based on the stopping point of the chain or to non-stationary behaviours of the chain.\n\rReferences\rBarnard, John, and Donald B Rubin. 1999. “Miscellanea.

The typical analysis of individual level data involves the comparison of two interventions for which suitable measures of clinical benefits and costs are observed on each patient enrolled in the trial at different time points throughout the follow up. Individual level data from RCTs are almost invariably affected by missingness. The recorded outcome process is often incomplete due to individuals who drop out or are observed intermittently throughout the study, causing some observations to be missing. In most applications, the economic evaluation is performed on the cross-sectional variables, computed using only the data from the individuals who are observed at each time point in the trial (completers), with at most limited sensitivity analysis to missingness assumptions. This, however, is an extremely inefficient approach as the information from the responses of all partially observed subjects is completely lost and it is also likely biased unless the completers are a random sample of the subjects on each arm. The problem of missingness is often embedded within a more complex framework, which makes the modelling task in economic evaluations particularly challenging. Specifically, the effectiveness and cost data typically present a series of complexities that need to be simultaneously addressed to avoid biased results.\nUsing a recent randomised trial as our motivating example, we present a Bayesian parametric model for conducting inference on a bivariate health economic longitudinal response. We specify our model to account for the different types of complexities affecting the data while accommodating a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of alternative missingness assumptions on the inferences and on the decision-making process for health technology assessment.\nStandard approach To perform the economic evaluation, aggregated measures for both utilities and costs are typically derived from the longitudinal responses recorded in the study. QALYs ($e_{it}$) and total costs ($c_{it}$) measures are computed as:\n\\[ e_{it}=\\sum_{j=1}^{J}(u_{ijt}+u_{ij-1t})\\frac{\\delta_{j}}{2} \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\;\\ c_{it}=\\sum_{j=1}^{J}c_{ijt}, \\]\nwhere $t$ denotes the treatment group, while $\\delta_{j}=\\frac{\\text{Time}_{j}-\\text{Time}_{j-1}}{\\text{Unit of time}}$ is the percentage of the time unit (typically one year) which is covered between time $j-1$ and $j$ in the trial. The economic evaluation is then performed by applying some parametric model $p(e_{it},c_{it}\\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta)$, indexed by a set of parameters $\\boldsymbol \\theta$, to these cross-sectional quantities, typically using linear regression methods to account for the imbalance in some baseline variables between treatments. We note that the term cross-sectional here refers to analyses based on variables derived from the combination of repeated measurements collected at different times over the trial duration and not on data collected at a single point in time. Finally, QALYs and total costs population mean values are derived from the model:\n\\[ \\mu_{et} = \\text{E}\\left(e_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta\\right) \\;\\;\\; \\text{and} \\;\\;\\; \\mu_{ct} = \\text{E}\\left(c_{it} \\mid \\boldsymbol \\theta \\right). \\]\nThe differences in $\\mu_{et}$ and $\\mu_{ct}$ between the treatment groups represent the quantities of interest in the economic evaluation and are used in assessing the relative cost-effectiveness of the interventions. This modelling approach has the limitation that $\\mu_{et}$ and $\\mu_{ct}$ are derived based only on the completers in the study and does not assess the robustness of the results to a range of plausible missingness assumptions. The model also fails to account for the different complexities that affect the utility and cost data in the trial: from the correlation between variables to the skewness and the presence of structural values (zero for the costs and one for the utilities) in both outcomes.\nLongitudinal model to deal with missingness We propose an alternative approach to deal with a missing bivariate outcome in economic evaluations, while simultaneously allowing for the different complexities that typically affect utility and cost data. Our approach includes a longitudinal model that improves the current practice by taking into account the information from all observed data as well as the time dependence between the responses.\nLet $\\boldsymbol u_i=(u_{i0},\\ldots,u_{iJ})$ and $\\boldsymbol c_i=(c_{i0},\\ldots,c_{iJ})$ denote the vectors of utilities and costs that were supposed to be observed for subject $i$ at time $j$ in the study, with $j \\in {0,1,J}$. We denote with $\\boldsymbol y_{ij}=(u_{ij},c_{ij})$ the bivariate outcome for subject $i$ formed by the utility and cost pair at time $j$. We group the individuals according to the missingness patterns and denote with $\\boldsymbol r_{ij}=(r^u_{ij},r^c_{ij})$ a pair of indicator variables that take value $1$ if the corresponding outcome for subject $i$ at time $j$ is observed and $0$ otherwise. We denote with $\\boldsymbol r_i = (\\boldsymbol r_{i0}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol r_{iJ})$ the missingness pattern to which subject $i$ belongs, where each pattern is associated with different values for $\\boldsymbol r_{ij}$.\nWe then define our modelling strategy and factor the joint distribution for the response and missingness as:\n\\[ p(\\boldsymbol y, \\boldsymbol r \\mid \\boldsymbol \\omega) = p(\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \\boldsymbol r \\mid \\boldsymbol \\omega)p(\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{mis} \\mid \\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \\boldsymbol r, \\boldsymbol \\omega) \\]\nwhere $\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{obs}$ and $\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{mis}$ indicate the observed and missing responses within pattern $\\boldsymbol r$, respectively. This is the extrapolation factorisation and factors the joint into two components, of which the extrapolation distribution $p(\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{mis} \\mid \\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \\boldsymbol r, \\boldsymbol \\omega)$ remains unidentified by the data in the absence of unverifiable assumptions about the full data.\nTo specify the observed data distribution $p(\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \\boldsymbol r \\mid \\boldsymbol \\omega)$ we use a working model $p^{\\star}$ for the joint distribution of the response and missingness. Essentially, the idea is to use the working model $p^{\\star}(\\boldsymbol y, \\boldsymbol{r} \\mid \\boldsymbol \\omega)$ to draw inferences about the distribution of the observed data $p(\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \\boldsymbol r \\mid \\boldsymbol \\omega)$ by integrating out the missing responses:\n\\[ p(\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \\boldsymbol r \\mid \\boldsymbol \\omega) = \\int p^{\\star}(\\boldsymbol y, \\boldsymbol{r} \\mid \\boldsymbol \\omega)d \\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{mis}. \\]\nThis approach avoids direct specification of the joint distribution of the observed and missing data $p(\\boldsymbol y, \\boldsymbol r\\mid \\boldsymbol \\omega)$, which has the undesirable consequence of identifying the extrapolation distribution with assumptions that are difficult to check. Indeed, since we use $p^{\\star}(\\boldsymbol y, \\boldsymbol r \\mid \\boldsymbol \\omega)$ only to obtain a model for $p(\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \\boldsymbol r \\mid \\boldsymbol \\omega)$ and not as a basis for inference, the extrapolation distribution is left unidentified. Any inference depending on the observed data distribution may be obtained using the working model as the true model, with the advantage that it is often easier to specify a model for the the full data $p(\\boldsymbol y,\\boldsymbol r)$ compared with a model for the observed data $p(\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{obs},\\boldsymbol r)$.\nWe specify $p^{\\star}$ using a pattern mixture approach, factoring the joint $p(\\boldsymbol y,\\boldsymbol r \\mid \\boldsymbol \\omega)$ as the product between the marginal distribution of the missingness patterns $p(\\boldsymbol r\\mid \\boldsymbol \\psi)$ and the distribution of the response conditional on the patterns $p(\\boldsymbol y\\mid \\boldsymbol r,\\boldsymbol \\theta)$, respectively indexed by the distinct parameter vectors $\\boldsymbol \\psi$ and $\\boldsymbol \\theta$. If missingness is monotone it is possible to summarise the patterns by dropout time and directly model the dropout process. Unfortunately, as it often occurs in trial-based health economic data, missingness in the case study is mostly nonmonotone and the sparsity of the data in most patterns makes it infeasible to fit the response model within each pattern, with the exception of the completers ($\\boldsymbol r = \\boldsymbol 1$). Thus, we decided to collapse together all the non-completers patterns ($\\boldsymbol r \\neq \\boldsymbol 1$) and fit the model separately to this aggregated pattern and to the completers. The joint distribution has three components. The first is given by the model for the patterns and the model for the completers ($\\boldsymbol r = \\boldsymbol 1$), where no missingness occurs. The second component is a model for the observed data in the collapsed patterns $\\boldsymbol r \\neq \\boldsymbol 1$ that, together with the first component, form the observed data distribution. The last component is the extrapolation distribution.\nBecause the targeted quantities of interest can be derived based on the marginal utility and cost means at each time $j$, in our analysis we do not require the full identification of $p(\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{mis} \\mid \\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \\boldsymbol r,\\boldsymbol \\xi)$. Instead, we only partially identify the extrapolation distribution using partial identifying restrictions. Specifically, we only require the identification of the marginal means for the missing responses in each pattern. We identify the marginal mean of $\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{mis}$ using the observed values, averaged across $\\boldsymbol r^\\prime \\neq \\boldsymbol 1$, and some sensitivity parameters $\\boldsymbol \\Delta = (\\Delta_u,\\Delta_c)$. Therefore, we compute the marginal means by averaging only across the observed components in pattern ${\\boldsymbol r}^\\prime$ and ignore the components that are missing.\nWe start by setting a benchmark assumption with $\\boldsymbol \\Delta = \\boldsymbol 0$, and then explore the sensitivity of the results to alternative scenarios by using different prior distributions on $\\boldsymbol \\Delta$, calibrated on the observed data. This provides a convenient benchmark scenario from which departures can be explored using alternative informative priors on $\\boldsymbol \\Delta$. Once the working model has been fitted to the observed data and the extrapolation distribution has been identified, the overall marginal mean for the response model can be computed by marginalising over $\\boldsymbol r$, i.e. $\\text{E}\\left[\\boldsymbol Y\\right] = \\sum_{\\boldsymbol r} p(\\boldsymbol r)\\text{E}\\left[\\boldsymbol Y \\mid \\boldsymbol r \\right]$.\nModelling framework The distribution of the observed responses $\\boldsymbol y_{ijt}=(u_{ijv},c_{ijt})$ is specified in terms of a model for the utility and cost variables at time $j=0,1,2$, which are jointly modelled without using a multilevel approach and separately by treatment group. In particular, the joint distribution for $\\boldsymbol y_{ijt}$ is specified as a series of conditional distributions that capture the dependence between utilities and costs as well as the time dependence.\nFollowing the recommendations from the published literature, we account for the skewness using Beta and Log-Normal distributions for the utilities and costs, respectively. Since the Beta distribution does not allow for negative values, we scaled the utilities on $[0,1]$ through the transformation $u^{\\star}_{ij}=\\frac{u_{ij}-\\text{min}(\\boldsymbol u_{j})}{\\text{max}(\\boldsymbol u_{j})-\\text{min}(\\boldsymbol u_{j})}$, and fit the model to these transformed variables. To account for the structural values $u_{ij} = 1$ and $c_{ij} = 0$ we use a hurdle approach by including in the model the indicator variables $d^u_{ij}:=\\mathbb{I}(u_{ij}=1)$ and $d^c_{ij}:=\\mathbb{I}(c_{ij}=0)$, which take value $1$ if subject $i$ is associated with a structural value at time $j$ and 0 otherwise. The probabilities of observing these values, as well as the mean of each variable, are then modelled conditionally on other variables via linear regressions defined on the logit or log scale. Specifically, at time $j=1,2$, the probability of observing a zero and the mean costs are modelled conditionally on the utilities and costs at the previous times, while the probability of observing a one and the mean utilities are modelled conditionally on the current costs (also at $j=0$) and the utilities at the previous times (only at $j=1,2$). The model is summarised by the following Figure.\n\rLongitudinal model for missingness.\r\r\rWe use partial identifying restrictions to link the observed data distribution $p(\\boldsymbol y_{obs},\\boldsymbol r)$ to the extrapolation distribution $p(\\boldsymbol y_{mis} \\mid \\boldsymbol y_{obs},\\boldsymbol r)$ and consider interpretable deviations from a benchmark scenario to assess how inferences are driven by our assumptions. Specifically, we identify the marginal mean of the missing responses in each pattern $\\boldsymbol y^{\\boldsymbol r}_{mis}$ by averaging across the corresponding components that are observed and add the sensitivity parameters $\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j$.\nWe define $\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j=(\\Delta_{c_{j}},\\Delta_{u_{j}})$ to be time-specific location shifts at the marginal mean in each pattern and set $\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j = \\boldsymbol 0$ as the benchmark scenario. We then explore departures from this benchmark using alternative priors on $\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j$, which are calibrated using the observed standard deviations for costs and utilities at each time $j$ to define the amplitude of the departures from $\\boldsymbol \\Delta_j=\\boldsymbol 0$.\nConlcusions Missingness represents a threat to economic evaluations as, when dealing with partially-observed data, any analysis makes assumptions about the missing values that cannot be verified from the data at hand. Trial-based analyses are typically conducted on cross-sectional quantities, e.g. QALYs and total costs, which are derived based only on the observed data from the completers in the study. This is an inefficient approach which may discard a substantial proportion of the sample, especially when there is a relatively large number of time points, where individuals are more likely to have some missing value or to drop out from the study. In addition, when there are systematic differences between the responses of the completers and non-completers, which is typically the case when dealing with self-reported outcomes in trial-based analyses, the results based only on the former may be biased and mislead the final assessment. A further concern is that routine analyses typically rely on standard models that ignore or at best fail to properly account for potentially important features in the data such as correlation, skewness, and the presence of structural values.\nOur framework represents a considerable step forward for the handling of missingness in economic evaluations compared with the current practice, which typically relies on methods that assume an ignorable MAR and rarely conducts sensitivity analysis to MNAR departures. Nevertheless, further improvements are certainly possible. For example, a potential area for future work is to increase the flexibility of our approach through a semi-parametric or nonparametric specification for the observed data distribution, which would allow a weakening of the model assumptions and likely further improve the fit of the model to the observed data and address sparse patterns in an automated way. As for the extrapolation distribution, alternative identifying restrictions that introduce the sensitivity parameters via the conditional mean (rather than the marginal mean) could be considered, and their impact on the conclusions assessed in a sensitivity analysis.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"64ed545a4c3df615031db54dc419fefc","permalink":"/project/missing-data/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/missing-data/","section":"project","summary":"With [Michael Daniels](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~daniels/) and [Gianluca Baio](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/gianlucabaio)","tags":["Missing Data"],"title":"Nonignorable Missingness Models in HTA","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["rubric"],"content":"\r\rThe notion of reducing bias due to missingness through reweighting methods has its root in the survey literature and the basic idea is closely related to weighting in randomisation inference for finite population surveys (Little and Rubin (2019)). In particular, in probability sampling, a unit selected from a target population with probability \\(\\pi_i\\) can be thought as “representing” \\(\\pi^{-1}_i\\) units in the population and hence should be given weight \\(\\pi^{-1}_i\\) when estimating population quantities. For example, in a stratified random sample, a selected unit in stratum \\(j\\) represents \\(\\frac{N_j}{n_j}\\) population units, where \\(n_j\\) indicates the units sampled from the \\(N_j\\) population units in stratum \\(j=1,\\ldots,J\\). The population total \\(T\\) can then be estimated by the weighted sum\n\\[\rT = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i\\pi^{-1}_i,\r\\]\nknown as the Horvitz-Thompson estimate (Horvitz and Thompson (1952)), while the stratified mean can be written as\n\\[\r\\bar{y}_{w} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_iy_i,\r\\]\nwhere \\(w_i=\\frac{n\\pi^{-1}_i}{\\sum_{k=1}^n\\pi^{-1}_k}\\) is the sampling weight attached to the \\(i\\)-th unit scaled tosum up to the sample size \\(n\\). Weighting class estimators extend this approach to handle missing data such that, if the probabilities of response for unit \\(\\phi_i\\) were known, then the probability of selection and response is \\(\\pi_i\\phi_i\\) and we have\n\\[\r\\bar{y}_{w} = \\frac{1}{n_r}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_r}w_iy_i,\r\\]\nwhere the sum is now over responding units and \\(w_i=\\frac{n_r(\\pi_i\\phi_i)^{-1}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n_r}(\\pi_k\\phi_k)^{-1}}\\). In practice, the response probability \\(\\phi_i\\) is not known and is typically estimated based on the information available for respondents and nonrespondents (Schafer and Graham (2002)).\nWeighting Class Estimator of the Mean\rA simple reweighting approach is to partition the sample into \\(J\\) “weighting classes” according to the variables observed for respondents and nonrespondents. If \\(n_j\\) is the sample size, \\(n_{rj}\\) the number of respondents in class \\(j\\), with \\(n_r=\\sum_{j=1}^Jr_j\\), then a simple estimator of the response probability for units in class \\(j\\) is given by \\(\\frac{n_{rj}}{n_j}\\). Thus, responding units in class \\(j\\) receive weight \\(w_i=\\frac{n_r(\\pi_i\\hat{\\phi}_i)^{-1}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n_r}(\\pi_k\\hat{\\phi}_k)^{-1}}\\), where \\(\\hat{\\phi}_i=\\frac{n_{rj}}{n_j}\\) for unit \\(i\\) in class \\(j\\). The weighting class estimate of the mean is then\n\\[\r\\bar{y}_{w} = \\frac{1}{n_r}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_r}w_iy_i,\r\\]\nwhich is unbiased under the quasirandomisation assumption (Oh and Scheuren (1983)), which requires respondents in weighting class \\(j\\) to be a random sample of the sampled units, i.e. data are Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) within adjustment class \\(j\\). Weighting class adjustments are simple because the same weights are obtained regardless of the outcome tp which they are applied, but these are inefficient and generally involves an increase in sampling variance for outcomes that are weakly related to the weighting class variable. Assuming random sampling within weighting classes, a constant variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) for an outcome \\(y\\), and ignoring sampling variation in the weights, the increase in sampling variance of a sample mean is\n\\[\r\\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{n_{r}}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{r}}w_iy_i \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_{r}^2}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{r}}w_{i}^{2} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_{r}}(1+\\text{cv}^2(w_i)),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\text{cv}(w_i)\\) is the coefficient of variation of the weights (scaled to average one), which is a rough measure of the proportional increase in sampling variance due to weighting (Kish (1992)). When the weighting class variable is predictive of \\(y\\), weighting methods can lead to a reduction in sampling variance. Little and Rubin (2019) summarise the effect of weighting on the bias and sampling variance of an estimated mean, according to whether the associations between the adjustment cells and the outcome \\(y\\) and missing indicator \\(m\\) are high or low.\n\rTable 1: Effect of weighting adjustments on bias and sampling variance of a mean.\r\r\r\r\rLow (y)\r\rHigh (y)\r\r\r\r\r\rLow (m)\r\rbias: /, var: /\r\rbias: /, var: -\r\r\r\rHigh (m)\r\rbias: /, var: +\r\rbias: -, var: -\r\r\r\r\rThus, weighting is only effective when the outcome is associated with the adjustment cell variable because otherwise the sampling variance is increased with no bias reduction.\n\rPropensity Weighting\rIn some settings, weighting class estimates cannot be feasibly derived by all recorded variables X because the number of classes become too large and some may include cells with nonrespondents but no respondents for which the nonresponse weight is infinite. The theory of propensity scores (Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)) provides a prescription for choosing the coarsest reduction of the variables to a weighting class variable \\(c\\). Suppose the data are Missing At Random (MAR) such that\n\\[\rp(m\\mid X,y,\\phi)=p(m\\mid X,\\phi),\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\phi\\) are unknown parameters and define the nonresponse propensity for unit \\(i\\) as\n\\[\r\\rho(x_i,\\phi)=p(m_i=1 \\mid \\phi),\r\\]\nassuming that this is strictly positive for all values of \\(x_i\\). Then, it can be shown that\n\\[\rp(m\\mid \\rho(X,\\phi),y,\\phi)=p(m\\mid \\rho(X,\\phi),\\phi),\r\\]\nso that respondents are a random subsample within strata defined by the propensity score \\(\\rho(X,\\phi)\\). In practice the parameter \\(\\phi\\) is unknown and must be estimated from sample data, for example via logistic, probit or robit regressions of the missingness indicator \\(m\\) on \\(X\\) based on respondent and nonrespondent data (Liu (2004)). A variant of this procedure is to weight respondents \\(i\\) directly by the inverse of the estimated propensity score \\(\\rho(X,\\hat{\\phi})^{-1}\\) (Cassel, Sarndal, and Wretman (1983)), which allows to remove bias but may cause two problems: 1) estimates may be associated with very high sampling variances due to nonrespondents with low response propensity estimates receiving large nonresponse weights; 2) more reliance on correct model specification of the propensity score regression than response propensity stratification.\n\rReferences\rCassel, Claes M, Carl-Erik Sarndal, and Jan H Wretman. 1983. “Some Uses of Statistical Models in Connection with the Nonresponse Problem.” Incomplete Data in Sample Surveys 3: 143–60.\n\rHorvitz, Daniel G, and Donovan J Thompson. 1952. “A Generalization of Sampling Without Replacement from a Finite Universe.” Journal of the American Statistical Association 47 (260): 663–85.\n\rKish, Leslie. 1992. “Weighting for Unequal Pi.” Journal of Official Statistics 8 (2): 183.\n\rLittle, Roderick JA, and Donald B Rubin. 2019.

In particular, in probability sampling, a unit selected from a target population with probability \\(\\pi_i\\) can be thought as “representing” \\(\\pi^{-1}_i\\) units in the population and hence should be given weight \\(\\pi^{-1}_i\\) when estimating population quantities.","tags":["Weighting Methods","Semiparametric Methods","Weighting Adjustments","Inverse Probability Weighting","Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting"],"title":"Weighting Adjustments","type":"missmethods"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"9e79f36b90901f58b3acd71bf9fdeeb8","permalink":"/missingdata/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/missingdata/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Missing Data","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Research","type":"widget_page"}]
