      <title>HESG Summer Meeting 2019</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have just come back form my first Health Economists&amp;rsquo; Study Group (&lt;a href=&#34;https://hesg.org.uk/meetings/summer-2019-university-of-east-anglia/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HESG&lt;/a&gt;) meeting, which this year was held at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uea.ac.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;University of East Anglia&lt;/a&gt; in the beautiful city of Norwich,
south east of England, and where I presented some preliminary results from one of my on-going works. I have to say, it was a remarkable experience which
I really liked thanks to a wonderful and welcoming environment. I had the pleasure to talk to many people from different research areas involved in
health economics (both from academia and industry) and to see many different projects and works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly enjoy the structure of the meeting, which requires some chair and discussant who have to present and discuss the paper of the authors,
who are only allowed to provide some clarification if needed. At first I thought this structure of the sessions was strange, but after attending many
sessions and experiencing this for my own paper, I feel that it is a very good way to encourage discussion about works from different people rather than
just focussing on your own presentation. Plus, the weather and always sunny, it felt like Italy for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Other nice people and colleagues from HEART and other UCL department came to HESG with me, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=CSCLA53&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Caroline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/comprehensive-clinical-trials-unit/meet-team/health-economics/junior-health-economist-ekaterina-kuznetsova&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ekaterina&lt;/a&gt; (aka Katia),
you can see them in thumbnail of this post. I was also pleased to meet &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/leurent.baptiste&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Baptiste&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LSHTM&lt;/a&gt;, who shares with me the interest in missing data
methods for cost-effectiveness analysis and who presented some very nice work on that. I had the chance to give some feedback to him and he did the same for me.
It felt so nice when we started discussing about some aspects of our analyses and after some minutes we simply lost track of time and everyone else disappeared.
I also had the opportunity to talk about my work with the discussant of my session, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cheme.bangor.ac.uk/CatrinPlumptonBiography.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Catrin Plumpton&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cheme.bangor.ac.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Centre for Health Economics and Medicines Evaluation&lt;/a&gt;,
who gave me some nice feedback which I really appreciated, especially given her mathematical background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important contribution to the success of the meeting was also given by the wonderful organisation of the event, including an accommodation located very closely
to the main building of the meeting, plenty of food provided during each day, a nice bus tour of the city and a wonderful conference dinner. I must thank all the people,
who organised the event who were very extremely nice to us and who were always ready to help us for whatever need we had, with a special mention for &lt;a href=&#34;https://people.uea.ac.uk/emma_mcmanus&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Emma Mcmanus&lt;/a&gt; who
was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, everything was good. Well, almost. Going back to the works presented, as usual, the only less positive note that I would like to make
is the almost total absence of Bayesian applications. Some authors mentioned that they used some popular Bayesian program, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/the-bugs-project-winbugs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;WinBUGS&lt;/a&gt;, but this was
mainly related to the usual meta-analysis stuff which is pretty standardised. I hope next time I will be able to see more people going Bayesian as this is what I am.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding health economics in clinical trials</title>
      <link>/post/introduction-to-health-economics/understanding-health-economics-in-clinical-trials/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/introduction-to-health-economics/understanding-health-economics-in-clinical-trials/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As member of the Health Economics Analysis and Research Methods Team (&lt;a href=&#34;https://hearteam.blogspot.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HEART&lt;/a&gt;), together with my colleagues, on Tuesday 2 July I took part in a 1-day introductory short course entitled “Understanding health economics in clinical trials”, which was designed and delivered by the team. HEART is a new group of health economists who are based in UCL’s Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology (ICTM), led by &lt;a href=&#34;https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=RMHUN48&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rachael Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, and is involved at different levels in the economic components of clinical trials in different trial units at UCL. This short course was aimed at ICTM staff who are not health economists (e.g. trial managers, CIs/PIs, statisticians, data managers, research assistants, etc.) and was designed in response to the need we have identified over the last few years in working on trials as well as in response to colleagues across ICTM. This course was unique as it was intended specifically for non health economists working in trials, who wish to better understand the health economics in their study, and/or the health economist on their study. The course used a mix of lectures, group discussions and practical exercises to help participants consolidate their learning and see how to apply information from the sessions to real studies. No prior knowledge of health economics was assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the course was a success both in terms of the quality/quantity of the material covered during the six sessions throughout the day, as well as in terms of the positive feedback we received from the participants (almost entirely women, with the exception of two men). Many key and typically not well understood economic topics were discussed during the day, e.g. what are and how QALYs and costs are calculated, the potential limitations and issues of an economic analysis within a trial, or the role played by the protocol and analysis plan in the economic evaluation. My session was related to reporting and interpreting health economic results and I realised that most people who do not routinely deal with health economics may find difficult to grasp certain concepts or tools used in the economic analysis (e.g. what is a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve and how it can be computed). Nevertheless, I must admit that I was surprised by how many people were very motivated to learn these concepts and these &amp;ldquo;difficult&amp;rdquo; methods, often asking questions and making good comments (despite the fact that my session was the last of the course at the end of the day).&lt;br /&gt;
We ran this course as a trial as we did not have clear ideas of what an optimal design should be or the number of topics that should be covered for this type of course. We are now confident that the course has a solid structure and that there is a clear demand to learn the basic concepts of health economics, at least among people involved in trial analyses. Following the successful delivery of the course, we are planning to replicate the experience in the future, improving certain aspects of the sessions based on the feedback we received and also considering to open the course to meet the demand of a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/bQrVMr3CO3QaY/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say that this was an extremely positive experience for me as it was the first time I was involved in this type of projects. Me and my colleagues worked hard to design and prepare the different sessions of the course over the last few months, find the best way to link the arguments across the sessions, provide interesting group activities and materials for the practicals, etc. I have to thank all my colleagues who contributed to the promotion and realisation of this project, with a special mention for &lt;a href=&#34;https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=CSCLA53&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Caroline Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, who spent a lot of time and effort to organise the course and who personally contributed in giving one of the session of the course. Finally, I would also like to thank my colleague and health economist &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/comprehensive-clinical-trials-unit/meet-team/health-economics/junior-health-economist-ekaterina-kuznetsova&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ekaterina&lt;/a&gt;, with whom I had the pleasure to share the presentation and practical of my session in the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the only true negative aspect of the course was the absence of a Bayesian perspective, especially related to the interpretation of the results and the statistical methods that can be used to perform the analysis. Given the generally low familiarity of the people attending the course with statistics, I believe it was reasonable not to further confuse them with another new element into the picture. However, I truly hope that people will become more and more familiar with the importance of using tailored statistical methods in economic evaluations to avoid biased results, and from that point to justify a Bayesian approach, well, at least for me, the step is straightforward!.&lt;/p&gt;
