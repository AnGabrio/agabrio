      <title>New updates for missingHE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In spite of how incredibly busy I am at the moment, which is also weird considering the whole lockdown situation still going on, I managed to upload a new version (1.4.0) of my R package &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/index.html&#34;&gt;missingHE&lt;/a&gt; with exciting updates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who do not know, &lt;code&gt;missingHE&lt;/code&gt; is specifically designed to implement Bayesian models for the analysis of trial-based economic evaluations and provides different methods to handle missingness in either or both the effectiveness and cost outcomes. The cool new things in this version are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, random effects can now be specified for each model implemented in missingHE (I know, Bayesians should not talk about &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo; effects as we know that there are no real &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo; effects but the terms have become quite popular and many people would prefer this way). These include selection, hurdle and pattern mixture models. The package allows a flexible implementation of either random intercept only, random slope only and both random intecept and slope models based on the input given by the user. The random effects term is specified via the formula y ~ x + (x | z) where x is a covariate included also as a fixed effects in the model and z is the clustering variable over which the random effects for x are specified. It is possible to remove the random intercept if desired by adding 0 + inside the brackets (by default this is included).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, new types of posterior predictive checks can now be chosen using the function &lt;code&gt;ppc&lt;/code&gt; for each type of model fitted using the function of the package. These include plotting the Bayesian posterior p-values (which should not be confused with the usual p-values as they are completely different) based on the posterior replications of the models and a given statistics computed from the observed data. The statistic can be provided by the user under the form of a univariate function (e.g. mean or sd) or a specific type of bivariate function (e.g. cor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, a new generic function called coef has been added which allows to extract the regression coefficients from each type of model, either in terms of fixed effects or random effects (if specified).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am quite proud of this new update as it is something I considered for a long time which is now available. If even one person find this useful, I think it will be worth all my effort. Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and yes you can also find the new version of &lt;code&gt;missingHE&lt;/code&gt; on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AnGabrio/missingHE&#34;&gt;GitHub page&lt;/a&gt;. I plan to upload a more serious tutorial on how to use all the functions of the package at some point (hopefully not too far from now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now that all the fun part is done, I need to go back to doing meetings, reviews, writing papers, etc&amp;hellip;. It will be a quite busy period again but now I feel motivated. Let&amp;rsquo;s see for how long this will last.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So much time but also not really</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The lockdown proceeds also here in the UK, as in the rest of the world, and at the moment we have no clear idea how long it will last. Not much we can do apart from staying at home all the time and practicing social distancing. I am still ok with living at home 24/7 but this has affected my productivity, especially in terms of collaborating with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have a lot of time to dedicate to some works, I am making a slow progress and the time of the day seems to fly in an instant with so many things to do. This months is particularly busy as I am trying to submit a revision for a paper which hanted me for quite a lot of time now and which I must finish by the first days of May. I am also working on side projects but these have been slowed down due to the current situation. I hope I can find the time (and the will) to do some more updates to my website by adding more tutorials and similar stuff. I do have some nice ideas about possible projects and collaboration but I need to wait until after this weird period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also planning to prepare a new version for my R package &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE&#34;&gt;missingHE&lt;/a&gt; to add some nice additional features for post-processing the results of Bayesian models and to implement new types of models. These, however, will take time, which at the moment is one thing that I do have but that I also do not have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, not much of an update this one, but I hope things will move quicker in the next couple of months or so.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Living and working at home is nice, right?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been roughtly a week and a half now since this whole shutdown started here in London and things are not going to be easy in the next few weeks. I am lucky, in that my job allows me to work remotely with limited inconveniences. Other people have to go outide for working and, if not risking thier life, at least put at risk the life of those who they care most. Last week was particularly bad in terms of supermarket products which were sold out for the most part. This week is a bit better as people may have realised that for the moment, if we just buy products as usual, we still have food and toilet paper for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, not much to update on my work which has slowed down due to this whole situation and also to me not feeling at my best. I hope I will have some time to look at the different projects I am involved with in the next few days. In the meantime, I worked a bit on my website with new JAGS and STAN tutorials and I have also uploaded on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AnGabrio&#34;&gt;GitHub page&lt;/a&gt; some materials (e.g. software code) related to some of the projects I did. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AnGabrio/Code/tree/master/volleyball&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; the link to the JAGS and STAN code for the model I used to predict volleyball results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what gif to use this time to conclude the post. So I guess I will just go for a random cat picture, which does not make any sense but which is always nice to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
