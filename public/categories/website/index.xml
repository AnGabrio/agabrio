      <title>So much time but also not really</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The lockdown proceeds also here in the UK, as in the rest of the world, and at the moment we have no clear idea how long it will last. Not much we can do apart from staying at home all the time and practicing social distancing. I am still ok with living at home 24/7 but this has affected my productivity, especially in terms of collaborating with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have a lot of time to dedicate to some works, I am making a slow progress and the time of the day seems to fly in an instant with so many things to do. This months is particularly busy as I am trying to submit a revision for a paper which hanted me for quite a lot of time now and which I must finish by the first days of May. I am also working on side projects but these have been slowed down due to the current situation. I hope I can find the time (and the will) to do some more updates to my website by adding more tutorials and similar stuff. I do have some nice ideas about possible projects and collaboration but I need to wait until after this weird period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also planning to prepare a new version for my R package &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE&#34;&gt;missingHE&lt;/a&gt; to add some nice additional features for post-processing the results of Bayesian models and to implement new types of models. These, however, will take time, which at the moment is one thing that I do have but that I also do not have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, not much of an update this one, but I hope things will move quicker in the next couple of months or so.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Living and working at home is nice, right?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been roughtly a week and a half now since this whole shutdown started here in London and things are not going to be easy in the next few weeks. I am lucky, in that my job allows me to work remotely with limited inconveniences. Other people have to go outide for working and, if not risking thier life, at least put at risk the life of those who they care most. Last week was particularly bad in terms of supermarket products which were sold out for the most part. This week is a bit better as people may have realised that for the moment, if we just buy products as usual, we still have food and toilet paper for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, not much to update on my work which has slowed down due to this whole situation and also to me not feeling at my best. I hope I will have some time to look at the different projects I am involved with in the next few days. In the meantime, I worked a bit on my website with new JAGS and STAN tutorials and I have also uploaded on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AnGabrio&#34;&gt;GitHub page&lt;/a&gt; some materials (e.g. software code) related to some of the projects I did. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AnGabrio/Code/tree/master/volleyball&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; the link to the JAGS and STAN code for the model I used to predict volleyball results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what gif to use this time to conclude the post. So I guess I will just go for a random cat picture, which does not make any sense but which is always nice to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
