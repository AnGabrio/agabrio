      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick update about some talks I gave/am about to give to advertise my research work. The one in Brighton, which I gave a couple of weeks a go at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ictmc2019.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ICTMC&lt;/a&gt;, went really well and I was glad to hear that some people were very interested in what I presented. For more info, here a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.luminpdf.com/viewer/5daad5f7ad8625001932b9a4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to my presentation about missing data methods for trial-based economic evaluations that I discussed.
Honestly, since the conference was mainly directed towards people working in clinical trials, I did not expect a huge interest in the use of Bayesian methods for economic evaluations, but apparently (and I am happy about that) I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the chance to chat a bit with few people that I did not know, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bristol.ac.uk/social-community-medicine/people/william-hollingworth/overview.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;William Hollingworth&lt;/a&gt; from Bristol and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/team/ines-rombach&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ines Rombach&lt;/a&gt; from Oxford, with whom I had very nice conversations about my work and other interesting topics.
I was also glad to meet some known faces, including the always lovely &lt;a href=&#34;https://cheme.bangor.ac.uk/CatrinPlumptonBiography.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Catrin Plumpton&lt;/a&gt; from Bangor University, who I met for the first time at HESG this summer and with whom I share the interest in missing data methods (even though she is a STATA and multiple imputation user, sadly).
I am also glad that I met my previous PhD secondary supervisor, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/mason.alexina&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alexina Mason&lt;/a&gt;, with whom it is always a pleasure to talk with. Unfortunately, we both missed the talk of each other becuase of time problems but it was good to catch up with her again. I am also sad that I could
not attend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/leurent.baptiste&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Baptiste&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s presentation which was the last day of the conference (I had to leave the same day of my talk, the first day) and I was not also able to actually meet him. I hope we will be able to see him soon at some other conference in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this past experience, I am now looking forward to meet new people at my next conference at the Bella Center in Copenhagen (thumbnail) where this year &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ispor.org/conferences-education/conferences/upcoming-conferences/ispor-europe-2019&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ISPOR Europe 2019&lt;/a&gt; will be held. However, I believe this will be a much larger conference and therefore I will probably not have many chances to talk with people as I did at ICTMC.
Plus I am only preseting a poster this time, so it will be less likely that some people will actually notice my work, especially given the typically huge amount of presenters of this type of conferences. In the wrost case, I will enjoy Copenhagen and meet up with some old friends who live in Denmark and who will come at ISPOR to present some other work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More good news...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have got two news coming up. First, the paper I wrote with Michael and Gianluca on Bayesian methdos for longitudinal data in trial-based economic evaluations has finally been published as early view on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rssa.12522&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JRSSA&lt;/a&gt;. As I said in some earlier posts, I am super happy about this collaboration and I hope I can continue working on similar projects in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I will soon give a talk about this work at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ictmc2019.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ICTMC&lt;/a&gt; conference in Brighton, next Monday. This will be the first time at this conference and unfortunately I will only be able to remain around for one day as I need to go back to London pretty soon. I hope I will be able to enjoy my day at the conference, even though I will miss the talks of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/leurent.baptiste&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Baptiste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/mason.alexina&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alexina&lt;/a&gt; which are scheduled for the last day of the conference. I hope I can at least have a quick chat with them the day I am around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/efDT7dqlF5N2LVHG8C/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also excited to visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Brighton&lt;/a&gt;, since many people keep telling me that I should go and visit this sort of british version of &amp;ldquo;Rimini&amp;rdquo;. To be honest, I do not expect to find a nice wheather, given that in this period it is raining a lot in London, but I hope I will be lucky and get the only sunny day of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have started a rubric called &lt;a href=&#34;https://agabrioblog.onrender.com/missingdata/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;missing data&lt;/a&gt; on my website, where I try to describe some of the most popular methods to handle missing data and to provide some references for anyone who could be interested in this field. I am really fascinated by statistical methods for dealing with missingness, perhaps because it was the main focus of my PhD, but I am eager to review different methods and see if I can find something really interesting. Of course, to complete this it will take more time, which I hope I will be able to find in the next months.&lt;/p&gt;
