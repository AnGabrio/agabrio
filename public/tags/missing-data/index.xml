      <title>MissingHE 1.2.1</title>
      <link>/post/missinghe-version121/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/missinghe-version121/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have finally found some time to update the version for my R package &lt;a href=&#34;https://agabrioblog.onrender.com/missingHE/&#34;&gt;missingHE&lt;/a&gt;, for which version 1.2.1 is now available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt;. 
I included two main features to the previous version of the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I have added a new type of identifying restriction when fitting pattern mixture models through the function &amp;ldquo;pattern&amp;rdquo;. Before, only the complete case
restriction was available, which identifies the distributions of the missing data with those from the completers. Now the alternative available case restriction is can also be selected, which relies on the distributions that can be identified 
among the non-completers to identify the distributions of the missing data. In this way, people can choose among at least two options for the type of restrictions and compare how this choice may affect the final estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I added a new accessory function called &amp;ldquo;ppc&amp;rdquo;, which allows to perform posterior predictive checks using the conditional parameters saved from the fitted model to generate replications of the data at each posterior iteration of the model.
The function implements a relatively large number of checks, mostly taken from the R package &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesplot/&#34;&gt;bayesplot&lt;/a&gt;, which allow to assess the fit of the model to the observed data by type of outcome (effects and costs) and treatment group (control and intervention).
For example, overalyed density plots can be generated to compare the empirical and replicated densities of the data to detect possible failures of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Density plots for the observed and replicated data&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel this is very important as when fitting a Bayesian model it is crucial to assess whether the model seems to adequately capture the different characteristics of the observed data (e.g. skewness, structural values, etc.). 
A wide range of predictive checks are available, including histograms (see thumbnail pciture), scatterplots, error intervals, empirical cumulative distribution fucntions, statistcis of interest and many others. In addition ,
these checks can be performed for each type of missingness model and parametric distribution chosen within missingHE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/NEvPzZ8bd1V4Y/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is important to remember that, when dealing with missing data the fit of the model can only be checked with respect to the observed values and therefore this 
check is only partial since the fit to the unibserved values can never be checked. This is also why it is not meaningful to assess the fit of a model fitted under a missing not at random assumption
because this is based on information which is not directly available from the data at hand and thus impossible to check.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;missingHE&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; package aimed at providing some useful tools to analysts in order to handle missing outcome data under a Full Bayesian framework in economic evaluations. The package relies on the &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; package &lt;code&gt;R2jags&lt;/code&gt; to implement Bayesian methods via the statistical software &lt;code&gt;JAGS&lt;/code&gt;. The package allows to obtain inferences using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods under a range of modelling approaches and missing data assumptions. The package also contains functions specifically defined to assess model fit and possible issues in model convergence as well as to summarise the main results from the economic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing data are iteratively imputed using data augmentation methods according to the type of model, distribution and missingness assumptions specified by the user using different arguments in the functions of the package. The posterior distribution of the main quantities of interest (e.g. some suitable measures of costs and clinical benefits) is then summarised to assess the cost-effectiveness of a new intervention ($t=2$) against a standard intervention ($t=1$).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;missingHE&lt;/code&gt; produces plots which compares the observed and imputed values for both cost and benefit measures in each treatment intervention considered to detect possible concerns about the plausibility of the imputation methods. In addition, the output of &lt;code&gt;missingHE&lt;/code&gt; cab be analysed using different funtions in the &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; package &lt;code&gt;BCEA&lt;/code&gt; which produces a synthesis of the decision process given the current evidence and uncertainty, as well as several indicators that can be used to perform Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis to parameter and model uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;news-and-updates-about-missinghe&#34;&gt;News and updates about &lt;code&gt;missingHE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From 25/09/2019, the updated version (1.2.1) of &lt;code&gt;missingHE&lt;/code&gt; has become available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt;, which allows to perform posterior predictive checks for each type of model as a further way to assess the fit of the model to the observed data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



  




&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;Example of posterior predictive checks in missingHE&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From 07/01/2020, the updated version (1.3.2) of &lt;code&gt;missingHE&lt;/code&gt; has become available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt;, which allows to choose among more distributions for the effectiveness measures, including continuous (Gamma, Weibull, Exponential, Logistic), discrete (Poisson, Negative Binomial) and binary (Bernoulli) health outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways of installing &lt;code&gt;missingHE&lt;/code&gt;. A &lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt; version (currently 1.3.2) is packaged and available from &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt;. You can simply type on your &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; terminal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34; data-lang=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;install.packages&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;missingHE&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second way involves using the &lt;em&gt;development&lt;/em&gt; version of &lt;code&gt;missingHE&lt;/code&gt;, which is available from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AnGabrio/missingHE&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; - this will usually be updated more frequently and may be continuously tested. On Windows machines, you need to install a few dependencies, including Rtools first, e.g. by running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34; data-lang=&#34;r&#34;&gt;pkgs &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;R2jags&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Rtools&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;devtools&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;before installing the package using &lt;code&gt;devtools&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34; data-lang=&#34;r&#34;&gt;devtools&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;install_github&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;AnGabrio/missingHE&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)

      <guid>/project/missinghe/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;missingHE&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; package, available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/missingHE/&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt; which is aimed at providing some useful tools to analysts in order to handle missing outcome data under a full Bayesian framework in economic evaluations. 
The package relies on the &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; package &lt;code&gt;R2jags&lt;/code&gt; to implement Bayesian methods via the statistical software &lt;code&gt;JAGS&lt;/code&gt; to obtain inferences using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.
Different types of missing data models are implemented in the package, including selection models, pattern mixture models and hurdle models. A range of parametric distributions can be specified when modelling the typical 
outcomes in an trial-based economic evaluations, namely the effectiveness and cost variabels, while simultaneously incorporating different assumptions about the missingness mechanism, which allows to easily perform 
sensitvity analysis to a range of alternative missing data assumptions according to the modelling choices selected by the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;missingHE&lt;/code&gt; also provides functions, taken and adapted from other &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; packages, to assess the results of each type of model, including summaries of the posterior distributions of each model parameter,
range and imputations of the missing values, different types of model diagnostics to assess convergence of the algorithm, posterior predictive checks, model assessment measures based on the fit to the observed data,
and a general summary of the economic evaluations, including the results from probabilistic sensitivity analyses which are automatically performed within a Bayesian modelling framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the function &lt;code&gt;plot&lt;/code&gt;, when applied to the output of a model fitted using &lt;code&gt;missingHE&lt;/code&gt;, produces graphs which compare the observed and imputed values for both cost and benefit measures in each treatment group to detect possible concerns about the plausibility of the imputations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Missingness Methods in trial-based CEA</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a systematic literature review that assesses the quality of the information reported and type of methods used to handle missing outcome data in trial-based economic evaluations. The purpose of this review is to critically appraise the current literature in within-trial CEAs with respect to the quality of the information reported and the methods used to deal with missingness for both effectiveness and costs. The review complements previous work, covering 2003-2009 (88 articles) with a new systematic review, covering 2009-2015 (81 articles) and focuses on two~perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we provide guidelines on how the information about missingness and related methods should be presented to improve the reporting and handling of missing data. We propose to address this issue by means of a &lt;em&gt;quality evaluation scheme&lt;/em&gt;, providing a structured approach that can be used to guide the collection of information, formulation of the assumptions, choice of methods, and considerations of possible limitations for the given missingness problem. Second, we review the description of the missing data, the statistical methods used to deal with them and the quality of the judgement underpinning the choice of these methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;quality-evaluation-scheme&#34;&gt;Quality Evaluation Scheme&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to judge whether missing data in CEAs have been adequately handled, we assembled guidelines from previous review articles on how information relating to the missing data should be reported. In particular, we defined three broad components of the analysis that are related to the description of the missingness problem (Description), details of the methods used to address it (Methods) and a discussion on the uncertainty in the conclusions resulting from the missingness (Limitations). For each component, information that is considered to be vital for transparency is listed under &lt;em&gt;key considerations&lt;/em&gt;, while other details that could usefully be provided as supplementary material are suggested under &lt;em&gt;optimal considerations&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the list of key considerations, we determine whether null (all key considerations absent), partial (one or more key considerations absent) or full (all key considerations present) information has been provided for each component. The set of key considerations is defined to ensure a full assessment of the impact that missingness may have on the final conclusions of the analysis with respect to all three components. However, providing a certain level of information on one component (e.g.~full information on Description) typically has a different impact on the results with respect to providing the same level of information on another component (e.g.~full information on Limitations). Based on this, we suggest computing a numerical score that weights each component by the impact that it may have on the final results to summarise the overall information provided on missingness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different score values are calculated based on whether full, partial or null information content is provided in each component and by weighting the three components in a ratio of 3:2:1 (Description: Method: Limitations). This weighting scheme has been chosen according to the impact that each component is likely to have on the final conclusions based on assumptions that we deemed to be~reasonable. Specifically, the Limitations component typically has the least importance among the three because of its limited impact on the conclusions. In the same way, the Description component has potentially a higher impact on the results than the Method component as it generally drives the choice for the initial assumptions about the missingness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the relevance of the scores in terms of decision analysis is mainly associated with a qualitative assessment of the articles. Therefore, we suggest converting the scores into ordered grades (A-E) to evaluate the studies based on the overall information reported on the handling of the missing data. Studies that are graded in the top categories should be associated with a higher degree of confidence in their results, whereas more caution should be given in the consideration of results coming from studies that are graded in the bottom categories. When qualitatively assessing the articles, the different grading assigned to each of them could be an indication of a lack in the robustness of the conclusions provided due to missingness uncertainty. 
With respect to the quality assessment of the studies, the aggregation of the quality scores on the components of the analysis (Description, Method and Limitations) into ordered grades could lead to some loss of information compared with the direct use of the quality scores on each component. However, merging the scores into a fewer number of categories ensures a relatively easy comparison of the quality of the information provided across the three analysis components and provides a useful indication about the different degree of confidence to assign to the results obtained by each study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Figure below shows a visual representation of the grade (and score) assignment in the quality evaluation scheme. Although the importance between the different components is subjective, the chosen structure represents a reasonable and relatively straightforward assessment scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The articles reviewed for the two periods are presented and compared by type of analysis performed. First, the base-case methods are considered, i.e.~those used in the main analysis. Second, any alternative methods in these analyses are discussed; when present, these assess the robustness of the results obtained in the main analysis against departures from the initial assumptions on missingness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary-of-the-findings&#34;&gt;Summary of the findings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our review is based on a sample of recently published studies and should therefore provide a picture of current missing data handling in within-trial CEAs. However, the quality assessment of the articles is based on the information reported in the articles. It is possible that authors had assessed the robustness of their conclusions to the missing data using alternative approaches that were not reported in the published version because of space limitations in journals. In these cases, it is important that on-line appendices and supplementary material are used to report these~alternatives.
In our literature review, information about missing data information and methods was available from $4$ and $9$ on-line supplementary materials for the period 2003-2009 and 2009-2015, respectively. Both the larger number of on-line materials and more detailed information reported about missingness handling in the analyses indicate an increased use of this tool in the later period (2009-2015) compared to the first period (2003-2009).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;Missingness methods by outcome and period.&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the comparison of the base-case methods used for the costs and effects between 2009 and 2015, the Figure above shows a marked reduction in the number of methods not clearly described for the effects, compared to those for the costs. A possible reason for this is that, while clinical effectiveness measures are often collected through self-reported questionnaires, which are naturally prone to missingness, cost measures rely more on clinical patient files which may ensure a higher completeness rate. It was not possible to confirm this interpretation in the reviewed studies due to the high proportions of articles not clearly reporting the missing rates in both 2003-2009 and 2009-2015 periods, for effects 
($\approx 45%$ and $\approx 38%$) and costs ( $\approx 50%$ and $\approx 62%$). In addition, clinical outcomes are almost invariably the main objective of RCTs and are usually subject to more advanced and standardised analyses. Arguably, costs are often considered as an add-on to the standard trial: for instance, sample size calculations are almost always performed with the effectiveness measure as the only outcome of interest. Consequently, missing data methods are less frequently well thought through for the analysis of the costs. However, this situation is likely to change as cost data from different perspectives (e.g. caregivers, patients, society, etc.) are being increasingly used in trials, leading to the more frequent adoption of self-report cost data which may start to exhibit similar missingness characteristics to effect data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review identified only a few articles using more than one alternative method. In addition, these analyses are typically conducted without any clear justification about their underlying missing data assumptions and may therefore not provide a concrete assessment of the impact of missingness uncertainty. This situation indicates a gap in the literature associated with an under-implementation of sensitivity analysis, which may significantly affect the whole decision-making process outcome, under the perspective of a body who is responsible for providing recommendations about the implementation of alternative interventions for health care matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limiting the assessment of missingness assumptions to a single case is unlikely to provide a reliable picture of the underlying mechanism. This, in turn, may have a significant impact on the CEA and mislead its conclusions, suggesting the implementation of non-cost-effective treatments. Robustness analyses assess the sensitivity of the results to alternative missing data methods but do not justify the choice of these methods and their underlying assumptions about missingness which may therefore be inappropriate in the specific context analysed. By contrast, sensitivity analyses, which rely on external information to explore plausible alternative methods and missingness assumptions, represent an important and more appropriate tool to provide realistic assessments of the impact of missing data uncertainty on the final conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quality-assessment&#34;&gt;Quality assessment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, most of the reviewed papers achieved an unsatisfactory quality score under the Quality Evaluation Scheme. Indeed, the benchmark area on the top-right corner of the graphs is barely reached by less than $7%$ of the articles, both for cost and effect data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the proportions of the studies associated with the lowest category (E) prevails in the majority of the years, with a similar pattern over time between missing costs and effects. All the articles that are associated with the top category (A) belong to the period 2013-2015, with the highest proportions of articles falling in this category being observed in 2015 for both outcomes.
The opportunity of reaching such a target might be precluded by the choice of the method adopted, which may not be able to support less restrictive assumptions about missingness, even when this would be desirable. As a result, when simple methods cannot be fully justified it is necessary to replace them with more flexible ones that can relax assumptions and incorporate more alternatives. In settings such as those involving MNAR, sensitivity analysis might represent the only possible approach to account for the uncertainty due to the missingness in a principled way. However, due to the lack of studies either performing a sensitivity analysis or providing high quality scores on the assumptions, missingness is not adequately addressed in most studies. This could have the serious consequence of imposing too restrictive assumptions about missingness and affect the outcome of decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our review shows, over time, a significant change from more to less restrictive methods in terms of the assumptions on the missingness mechanism. This is an encouraging movement towards a more suitable and careful missing data analysis. The results from the disaggregated analysis by year of publication in the later period (2009-2015) indicates the rise of a better and more transparent approach to handle missingness in the latest years of the review, especially in 2015. In particular, compared to the previous years, the articles reviewed from 2015 are associated with a higher proportion of MI methods used in the base-case analysis, a substantial increase in the number of robustness methods implemented, and a better quality score assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, improvements are still needed as, overall, only a small number of articles provide transparent information about the missing data and almost no study performs a sensitivity~analysis. These failings are probably due to the fact that the implications of using methods that do not handle missingness in a principled way are not well-known among practitioners. In addition, the choice of the missing data methods may also be guided by their ease of implementation in standard software packages rather than methodological reasons. This is a potentially serious issue for bodies such as the NICE who use these evaluations in their decision making, thus possibly leading to incorrect policy decisions about the cost-effectiveness of new treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quality Evaluation Scheme represents a valuable tool to improve missing data handling. By carefully thinking about each component in the analysis we are forced to explicitly consider all the assumptions we make about missingness and assess the impact of their variation on final conclusions. The main advantage is a more comparable formalisation of the uncertainty as well as a better indication of possible issues in assessing the cost-effectiveness of new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic evaluation alongside Randomised Clinical Trials (RCTs) is an important and increasingly popular component of the process of technology appraisal. The typical analysis of individual level data involves the comparison of two interventions for which suitable measures of clinical benefits and costs are observed on each patient enrolled in the trial at different time points throughout the follow up. Individual level data from RCTs are almost invariably affected by missingness. The recorded outcome process is often incomplete due to individuals who drop out or are observed intermittently throughout the study, causing some observations to be missing. In most applications, the economic evaluation is performed on the cross-sectional variables, computed using only the data from the individuals who are observed at each time point in the trial (completers), with at most limited sensitivity analysis to missingness assumptions. This, however, is an extremely inefficient approach as the information from the responses of all partially observed subjects is completely lost and it is also likely biased unless the completers are a random sample of the subjects on each arm. The problem of missingness is often embedded within a more complex framework, which makes the modelling task in economic evaluations particularly challenging. Specifically, the effectiveness and cost data typically present a series of complexities that need to be simultaneously addressed to avoid biased results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a recent randomised trial as our motivating example, we present a Bayesian parametric model for conducting inference on a bivariate health economic longitudinal response. We specify our model to account for the different types of complexities affecting the data while accommodating a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of alternative missingness assumptions on the inferences and on the decision-making process for health technology assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;standard-approach&#34;&gt;Standard approach&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To perform the economic evaluation, aggregated measures for both utilities and costs are typically derived from the longitudinal responses recorded in the study. QALYs ($e_{it}$) and total costs ($c_{it}$) measures are computed as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\[
e_{it}=\sum_{j=1}^{J}(u_{ijt}+u_{ij-1t})\frac{\delta_{j}}{2} ;;; \text{and} ;;;\  c_{it}=\sum_{j=1}^{J}c_{ijt},
\]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $t$ denotes the treatment group, while $\delta_{j}=\frac{\text{Time}_{j}-\text{Time}_{j-1}}{\text{Unit of time}}$ is the percentage of the time unit (typically one year) which is covered between time $j-1$ and $j$ in the trial. The economic evaluation is then performed by applying some parametric model $p(e_{it},c_{it}\mid \boldsymbol \theta)$, indexed by a set of parameters $\boldsymbol \theta$, to these cross-sectional quantities, typically using linear regression methods to account for the imbalance in some baseline variables between treatments. We note that the term cross-sectional here refers to analyses based on variables derived from the combination of repeated measurements collected at different times over the trial duration and not on data collected at a single point in time.
Finally, QALYs and total costs population mean values are derived from the model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\[
\mu_{et} = \text{E}\left(e_{it} \mid \boldsymbol \theta\right) ;;; \text{and} ;;; \mu_{ct} = \text{E}\left(c_{it} \mid \boldsymbol \theta \right). 
\]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences in $\mu_{et}$ and $\mu_{ct}$ between the treatment groups represent the quantities of interest in the economic evaluation and are used in assessing the relative cost-effectiveness of the interventions. This modelling approach has the limitation that $\mu_{et}$ and $\mu_{ct}$ are derived based only on the completers in the study and does not assess the robustness of the results to a range of plausible missingness assumptions. The model also fails to account for the different complexities that affect the utility and cost data in the trial: from the correlation between variables to the skewness and the presence of structural values (zero for the costs and one for the utilities) in both outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;longitudinal-model-to-deal-with-missingness&#34;&gt;Longitudinal model to deal with missingness&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose an alternative approach to deal with a missing bivariate outcome in economic evaluations, while simultaneously allowing for the different complexities that typically affect utility and cost data. Our approach includes a longitudinal model that improves the current practice by taking into account the information from all observed data as well as the time dependence between the responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let $\boldsymbol u_i=(u_{i0},\ldots,u_{iJ})$ and $\boldsymbol c_i=(c_{i0},\ldots,c_{iJ})$ denote the vectors of utilities and costs that were supposed to be observed for subject $i$ at time $j$ in the study, with $j \in {0,1,J}$. We denote with $\boldsymbol y_{ij}=(u_{ij},c_{ij})$ the bivariate outcome for subject $i$ formed by the utility and cost pair at time $j$. We group the individuals according to the missingness patterns and denote with $\boldsymbol r_{ij}=(r^u_{ij},r^c_{ij})$ a pair of indicator variables that take value $1$ if the corresponding outcome for subject $i$ at time $j$ is observed and $0$ otherwise. We denote with $\boldsymbol r_i = (\boldsymbol r_{i0}, \ldots, \boldsymbol r_{iJ})$ the missingness pattern to which subject $i$ belongs, where each pattern is associated with different values for $\boldsymbol r_{ij}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then define our modelling strategy and factor the joint distribution for the response and missingness as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\[
p(\boldsymbol y, \boldsymbol r \mid \boldsymbol \omega) = p(\boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \boldsymbol r \mid  \boldsymbol \omega)p(\boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{mis} \mid \boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \boldsymbol r, \boldsymbol \omega)
\]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $\boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{obs}$ and $\boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{mis}$ indicate the observed and missing responses within pattern $\boldsymbol r$, respectively. This is the extrapolation &lt;em&gt;factorisation&lt;/em&gt; and factors the joint into two components, of which the extrapolation &lt;em&gt;distribution&lt;/em&gt; $p(\boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{mis} \mid \boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \boldsymbol r, \boldsymbol \omega)$ remains unidentified by the data in the absence of unverifiable assumptions about the full data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To specify the observed data distribution $p(\boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \boldsymbol r \mid  \boldsymbol \omega)$ we use a working model $p^{\star}$ for the joint distribution of the response and missingness. Essentially, the idea is to use the working model $p^{\star}(\boldsymbol y, \boldsymbol{r} \mid  \boldsymbol \omega)$ to draw inferences about the distribution of the observed data $p(\boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \boldsymbol r \mid \boldsymbol \omega)$ by integrating out the missing responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\[
p(\boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \boldsymbol r \mid \boldsymbol \omega) = \int p^{\star}(\boldsymbol y, \boldsymbol{r} \mid  \boldsymbol \omega)d \boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{mis}.
\]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach avoids direct specification of the joint distribution of the observed and missing data $p(\boldsymbol y, \boldsymbol r\mid \boldsymbol \omega)$, which has the undesirable consequence of identifying the extrapolation distribution with assumptions that are difficult to check. Indeed, since we use $p^{\star}(\boldsymbol y, \boldsymbol r \mid  \boldsymbol \omega)$ only to obtain a model for $p(\boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{obs}, \boldsymbol r \mid  \boldsymbol \omega)$ and not as a basis for inference, the extrapolation distribution is left unidentified. Any inference depending on the observed data distribution may be obtained using the working model as the true model, with the advantage that  it is often easier to specify a model for the the full data $p(\boldsymbol y,\boldsymbol r)$ compared with a model  for the observed data $p(\boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{obs},\boldsymbol r)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We specify $p^{\star}$ using a pattern mixture approach, factoring the joint $p(\boldsymbol y,\boldsymbol r \mid \boldsymbol \omega)$ as the product between the marginal distribution of the missingness patterns $p(\boldsymbol r\mid \boldsymbol \psi)$ and the distribution of the response conditional on the patterns $p(\boldsymbol y\mid \boldsymbol r,\boldsymbol \theta)$, respectively indexed by the distinct parameter vectors $\boldsymbol \psi$ and $\boldsymbol \theta$. If missingness is monotone it is possible to summarise the patterns by dropout time and directly model the dropout process. Unfortunately, as it often occurs in trial-based health economic data, missingness in the case study is mostly nonmonotone and the sparsity of the data in most patterns makes it infeasible to fit the response model within each pattern, with the exception of the completers ($\boldsymbol r = \boldsymbol 1$). Thus, we decided to collapse together all the non-completers patterns ($\boldsymbol r \neq \boldsymbol 1$) and fit the model separately to this aggregated pattern and to the completers. The joint distribution has three components. The first is given by the model for the patterns and the model for the completers ($\boldsymbol r = \boldsymbol 1$), where no missingness occurs. The second component is a model for the observed data in the collapsed patterns $\boldsymbol r \neq \boldsymbol 1$ that, together with the first component, form the observed data distribution. The last component is the extrapolation distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the targeted quantities of interest can be derived based on the marginal utility and cost means at each time $j$, in our analysis we do not require the full identification of $p(\boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{mis} \mid \boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{obs},  \boldsymbol r,\boldsymbol \xi)$. Instead, we only partially identify the extrapolation distribution using &lt;em&gt;partial identifying restrictions&lt;/em&gt;. Specifically, we only require the identification of the marginal means for the missing responses in each pattern. We identify the marginal mean of $\boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{mis}$ using the observed values, averaged across $\boldsymbol r^\prime \neq \boldsymbol 1$, and some &lt;em&gt;sensitivity parameters&lt;/em&gt; $\boldsymbol \Delta = (\Delta_u,\Delta_c)$. Therefore, we compute the marginal means by averaging only across the observed components in pattern ${\boldsymbol r}^\prime$ and ignore the components that are missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start by setting a benchmark assumption with $\boldsymbol \Delta = \boldsymbol 0$, and then explore the sensitivity of the results to alternative scenarios by using different prior distributions on $\boldsymbol \Delta$, calibrated on the observed data. This provides a convenient benchmark scenario from which departures can be explored using alternative informative priors on $\boldsymbol \Delta$. Once the working model has been fitted to the observed data and the extrapolation distribution has been identified, the overall marginal mean for the response model can be computed by marginalising over $\boldsymbol r$, i.e. $\text{E}\left[\boldsymbol Y\right] = \sum_{\boldsymbol r} p(\boldsymbol r)\text{E}\left[\boldsymbol Y \mid \boldsymbol r \right]$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modelling-framework&#34;&gt;Modelling framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of the observed responses $\boldsymbol y_{ijt}=(u_{ijv},c_{ijt})$ is specified in terms of a model for the utility and cost variables at time $j=0,1,2$, which are jointly modelled without using a multilevel approach and separately by treatment group. In particular, the joint distribution for $\boldsymbol y_{ijt}$ is specified as a series of conditional distributions that capture the dependence between utilities and costs as well as the time dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the recommendations from the published literature, we account for the skewness using Beta and Log-Normal distributions for the utilities and costs, respectively. Since the Beta distribution does not allow for negative values, we scaled the utilities on $[0,1]$ through the transformation $u^{\star}_{ij}=\frac{u_{ij}-\text{min}(\boldsymbol u_{j})}{\text{max}(\boldsymbol u_{j})-\text{min}(\boldsymbol u_{j})}$, and fit the model to these transformed variables. To account for the structural values $u_{ij} = 1$ and $c_{ij} = 0$ we use a hurdle approach by including in the model the indicator variables $d^u_{ij}:=\mathbb{I}(u_{ij}=1)$ and $d^c_{ij}:=\mathbb{I}(c_{ij}=0)$, which take value $1$ if subject $i$ is associated with a structural value at time $j$ and 0 otherwise. The probabilities of observing these values, as well as the mean of each variable, are then modelled conditionally on other variables via linear regressions defined on the logit or log scale. Specifically, at time $j=1,2$, the probability of observing a zero and the mean costs are modelled conditionally on the utilities and costs at the previous times, while the probability of observing a one and the mean utilities are modelled conditionally on the current costs (also at $j=0$) and the utilities at the previous times (only at $j=1,2$). The model is summarised by the following Figure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;Longitudinal model for missingness.&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use partial identifying restrictions to link the observed data distribution $p(\boldsymbol y_{obs},\boldsymbol r)$ to the extrapolation distribution $p(\boldsymbol y_{mis} \mid \boldsymbol y_{obs},\boldsymbol r)$ and consider interpretable deviations from a benchmark scenario to assess how inferences are driven by our assumptions. Specifically, we identify the marginal mean of the missing responses in each pattern $\boldsymbol y^{\boldsymbol r}_{mis}$ by averaging across the corresponding components that are observed and add the sensitivity parameters $\boldsymbol \Delta_j$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We define $\boldsymbol \Delta_j=(\Delta_{c_{j}},\Delta_{u_{j}})$ to be time-specific location shifts at the marginal mean in each pattern and set $\boldsymbol \Delta_j = \boldsymbol 0$ as the benchmark scenario. We then explore departures from this benchmark using alternative priors on $\boldsymbol \Delta_j$, which are calibrated using the observed standard deviations for costs and utilities at each time $j$ to define the amplitude of the departures from $\boldsymbol \Delta_j=\boldsymbol 0$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conlcusions&#34;&gt;Conlcusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missingness represents a threat to economic evaluations as, when dealing with partially-observed data, any analysis makes assumptions about the missing values that cannot be verified from the data at hand. Trial-based analyses are typically conducted on cross-sectional quantities, e.g. QALYs and total costs, which are derived based only on the observed data from the completers in the study. This is an inefficient approach which may discard a substantial proportion of the sample, especially when there is a relatively large number of time points, where individuals are more likely to have some missing value or to drop out from the study. In addition, when there are systematic differences between the responses of the completers and non-completers, which is typically the case when dealing with self-reported outcomes in trial-based analyses, the results based only on the former may be biased and mislead the final assessment. A further concern is that routine analyses typically rely on standard models that ignore or at best fail to properly account for potentially important features in the data such as correlation, skewness, and the presence of structural values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our framework represents a considerable step forward for the handling of missingness in economic evaluations compared with the current practice, which typically relies on methods that assume an ignorable MAR and rarely conducts sensitivity analysis to MNAR departures. Nevertheless, further improvements are certainly possible. For example, a potential area for future work is to increase the flexibility of our approach through a semi-parametric or nonparametric specification for the observed data distribution, which would allow a weakening of the model assumptions and likely further improve the fit of the model to the observed data and address sparse patterns in an automated way. As for the extrapolation distribution, alternative identifying restrictions that introduce the sensitivity parameters via the conditional mean (rather than the marginal mean) could be considered, and their impact on the conclusions assessed in a sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
