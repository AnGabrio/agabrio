    <h2><a href="/post/update-april/">So much time but also not really</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The lockdown proceeds also here in the UK, as in the rest of the world, and at the moment we have no clear idea how long it will last. Not much we can do apart from staying at home all the time and practicing social distancing. I am still ok with living at home 24/7 but this has affected my productivity, especially in terms of collaborating with other people.
Although I have a lot of time to dedicate to some works, I am making a slow progress and the time of the day seems to fly in an instant with so many things to do.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/update2-march/">Living and working at home is nice, right?</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      It has been roughtly a week and a half now since this whole shutdown started here in London and things are not going to be easy in the next few weeks. I am lucky, in that my job allows me to work remotely with limited inconveniences. Other people have to go outide for working and, if not risking thier life, at least put at risk the life of those who they care most.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/update-march/">Lockdown</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I have to admit, although I expected some fear to spread because of the virus which is currently and quickly infecting the world, I was surprised by the frenzy surrounding us, especially in my homecountry (Italy) and particularly in my parents&rsquo; region which is at the moment under lockdown. I will also probably cancel my planned trip home for Eastern and perhaps also after that since the situations is still unclear and I may be unable to come back to the UK in the short time.

    <h2><a href="/post/update2-february/">Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The moment for the second edition of the HEART&rsquo;s one-day introductory course to health economics arrived at last! The course, led by Rachael Hunter and called &ldquo;Understanding health economics in clinical trials&rdquo;, took place on Tuesday 11 February and was prepared in collaboration between the HEART group and the Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology (ICTM). I believe this second edition of the course was a success both in terms of the quality/quantity of the material covered during the six sessions throughout the day, as well as in terms of the positive feedback we received from the participants.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/update-february/">Finally here ...</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The new year is finally taking off for me and I have a couple of updates. First, I would like to remind everyone about the exciting new course &ldquo;understanding health economics in clinical trials&rdquo; that me and the rest of our research team HEART have put together to support the dissemination of health economics among all people involved in the design and analysis of clinical trials. I look forward to deliver this one-day short course together with my colleagues from the UCL PCPH department which will be structured into different sessions during the day of Feb 11th at the UCL CCTU - 2nd Floor, 90 High Holborn, London.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/update-january2/">Let us do some work</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      After the terrible start of this year, things are going ok now and I am quite busy with different projects that I left a bit behind. First, I can confirm that me and my colleagues from the HEART group are going to give an introductory course to health economic evaluations next month for different groups of people from academia and clinical trial units. The course has been generally structured based on our &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; we gave last year (which went really well by the way) and involves many different topics that will cover the entire day of February 11th.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/update-january/">Not a very good start...</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      After some nice holiday break, I came back to work ready for an exciting 2020 &hellip; or so I thought. Unfortunately, I have recently been caught by a terrible flu which forced me to postpone my flight back to London of a week. The worst part is that I was basically a dead corpse moving around with high fever and an awful condition for more than 4 days. It was quite a bad experience which I rarely had in my life.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/update-november/">Too many things, again....</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      I did not have much time to post anything this month until now as it has been a quite busy period. I have been involved in many different works and I have also involved other people in what I think could be some very interesting new projects. Not that I complain about having many different things to do (most of them are actually cool) but doing everything in a short period is not the best.

  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/update3-october/">Copenhagen, I am coming ...</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Finally the time of ISPOR Europe 2019 has arrived and I will depart in a few days for Copenhagen, where the conference is held this year. I am actually looking forward to this as I am curious to see what type of conference ISPOR is, that is, whether I will be able to find some interesting works and have some &ldquo;applied statistics&rdquo;-related discussions or the attention is more placed on &ldquo;economics and clinical&rdquo; matters.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h2><a href="/post/update2-october/">Conferences updates and news</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Just a quick update about some talks I gave/am about to give to advertise my research work. The one in Brighton, which I gave a couple of weeks a go at ICTMC, went really well and I was glad to hear that some people were very interested in what I presented. For more info, here a link to my presentation about missing data methods for trial-based economic evaluations that I discussed.
