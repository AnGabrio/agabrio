<p>The notion of reducing bias due to missingness through <em>reweighting methods</em> has its root in the survey literature and the basic idea is closely related to weighting in randomisation inference for finite population surveys (<span class="citation">Little and Rubin (2019)</span>). In particular, in probability sampling, a unit selected from a target population with probability <span class="math inline">\(\pi_i\)</span> can be thought as “representing” <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{-1}_i\)</span> units in the population and hence should be given weight <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{-1}_i\)</span> when estimating population quantities. For example, in a stratified random sample, a selected unit in stratum <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> represents <span class="math inline">\(\frac{N_j}{n_j}\)</span> population units, where <span class="math inline">\(n_j\)</span> indicates the units sampled from the <span class="math inline">\(N_j\)</span> population units in stratum <span class="math inline">\(j=1,\ldots,J\)</span>. The population total <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> can then be estimated by the weighted sum</p>
<p>\[
T = \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i\pi^{-1}_i,
\]</p>
<p>known as the Horvitz-Thompson estimate (<span class="citation">Horvitz and Thompson (1952)</span>), while the stratified mean can be written as</p>
<p>\[
\bar{y}_{w} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_iy_i,
\]</p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(w_i=\frac{n\pi^{-1}_i}{\sum_{k=1}^n\pi^{-1}_k}\)</span> is the sampling weight attached to the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th unit scaled tosum up to the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Weighting class estimators extend this approach to handle missing data such that, if the probabilities of response for unit <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> were known, then the probability of selection and response is <span class="math inline">\(\pi_i\phi_i\)</span> and we have</p>
<p>\[
\bar{y}_{w} = \frac{1}{n_r}\sum_{i=1}^{n_r}w_iy_i,
\]</p>
<p>where the sum is now over responding units and <span class="math inline">\(w_i=\frac{n_r(\pi_i\phi_i)^{-1}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n_r}(\pi_k\phi_k)^{-1}}\)</span>. In practice, the response probability <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> is not known and is typically estimated based on the information available for respondents and nonrespondents (<span class="citation">Schafer and Graham (2002)</span>).</p>

<h2>Weighting Class Estimator of the Mean</h2>
<p>A simple reweighting approach is to partition the sample into <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> “weighting classes” according to the variables observed for respondents and nonrespondents. If <span class="math inline">\(n_j\)</span> is the sample size, <span class="math inline">\(n_{rj}\)</span> the number of respondents in class <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(n_r=\sum_{j=1}^Jr_j\)</span>, then a simple estimator of the response probability for units in class <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n_{rj}}{n_j}\)</span>. Thus, responding units in class <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> receive weight <span class="math inline">\(w_i=\frac{n_r(\pi_i\hat{\phi}_i)^{-1}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n_r}(\pi_k\hat{\phi}_k)^{-1}}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\phi}_i=\frac{n_{rj}}{n_j}\)</span> for unit <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in class <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. The weighting class estimate of the mean is then</p>
<p>\[
\bar{y}_{w} = \frac{1}{n_r}\sum_{i=1}^{n_r}w_iy_i,
\]</p>
<p>which is unbiased under the <em>quasirandomisation</em> assumption (<span class="citation">Oh and Scheuren (1983)</span>), which requires respondents in weighting class <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> to be a random sample of the sampled units, i.e. data are <em>Missing Completely At Random</em> (MCAR) within adjustment class <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. Weighting class adjustments are simple because the same weights are obtained regardless of the outcome tp which they are applied, but these are inefficient and generally involves an increase in sampling variance for outcomes that are weakly related to the weighting class variable. Assuming random sampling within weighting classes, a constant variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> for an outcome <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and ignoring sampling variation in the weights, the increase in sampling variance of a sample mean is</p>
<p>\[
\text{Var}\left(\frac{1}{n_{r}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{r}}w_iy_i \right) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n_{r}^2}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n_{r}}w_{i}^{2} \right) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n_{r}}(1+\text{cv}^2(w_i)),
\]</p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\text{cv}(w_i)\)</span> is the coefficient of variation of the weights (scaled to average one), which is a rough measure of the proportional increase in sampling variance due to weighting (<span class="citation">Kish (1992)</span>). When the weighting class variable is predictive of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, weighting methods can lead to a reduction in sampling variance. <span class="citation">Little and Rubin (2019)</span> summarise the effect of weighting on the bias and sampling variance of an estimated mean, according to whether the associations between the adjustment cells and the outcome <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and missing indicator <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> are high or low.</p>

<p>Thus, weighting is only effective when the outcome is associated with the adjustment cell variable because otherwise the sampling variance is increased with no bias reduction.</p>

<h2>Propensity Weighting</h2>
<p>In some settings, weighting class estimates cannot be feasibly derived by all recorded variables X because the number of classes become too large and some may include cells with nonrespondents but no respondents for which the nonresponse weight is infinite. The theory of propensity scores (<span class="citation">Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)</span>) provides a prescription for choosing the coarsest reduction of the variables to a weighting class variable <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Suppose the data are <em>Missing At Random</em> (MAR) such that</p>
<p>\[
p(m\mid X,y,\phi)=p(m\mid X,\phi),
\]</p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> are unknown parameters and define the nonresponse propensity for unit <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> as</p>
<p>\[
\rho(x_i,\phi)=p(m_i=1 \mid \phi),
\]</p>
<p>assuming that this is strictly positive for all values of <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>. Then, it can be shown that</p>
<p>\[
p(m\mid \rho(X,\phi),y,\phi)=p(m\mid \rho(X,\phi),\phi),
\]</p>
<p>so that respondents are a random subsample within strata defined by the propensity score <span class="math inline">\(\rho(X,\phi)\)</span>. In practice the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is unknown and must be estimated from sample data, for example via logistic, probit or robit regressions of the missingness indicator <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> based on respondent and nonrespondent data (<span class="citation">Liu (2004)</span>). A variant of this procedure is to weight respondents <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> directly by the inverse of the estimated propensity score <span class="math inline">\(\rho(X,\hat{\phi})^{-1}\)</span> (<span class="citation">Cassel, Sarndal, and Wretman (1983)</span>), which allows to remove bias but may cause two problems: 1) estimates may be associated with very high sampling variances due to nonrespondents with low response propensity estimates receiving large nonresponse weights; 2) more reliance on correct model specification of the propensity score regression than response propensity stratification.</p>
