abstract: "Aims: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of heart failure impairing patient wellbeing and imposing a substantial economic burden on society, but respective data are missing. This study aims to measure the quality of life (QoL) and societal costs of DCM patients. Methods and results: A cross-sectional evaluation of QoL and societal costs of DCM patients was performed through the 5-level EuroQol and the Medical Consumption Questionnaire and Productivity Cost Questionnaire, respectively. QoL was translated into numerical values (i.e. utilities). Costs were measured from a Dutch societal perspective. Final costs were extrapolated to 1 year, reported in 2022 Euros, and compared between DCM severity according to NYHA classes. A total of 550 DCM patients from the Maastricht cardiomyopathy registry were included. Mean age was 61 years, and 34% were women. Overall utility was slightly lower for DCM patients than the population mean (0.840 vs. 0.869, P = 0.225). Among EQ-5D dimensions, DCM patients scored lowest in ‘usual activities’. Total societal DCM costs were €14 843 per patient per year. Cost drivers were productivity losses (€7037) and medical costs (€4621). Patients with more symptomatic DCM (i.e. NYHA class III or IV) had significantly higher average DCM costs per year compared to less symptomatic DCM (€31 099 vs. €11 446, P < 0.001) and significantly lower utilities (0.631 vs. 0.883, P < 0.001). Conclusion: DCM is associated with high societal costs and reduced QoL, in particular with high DCM severity."
