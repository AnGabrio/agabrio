<p>With <strong>blogdown</strong>, you are able to take advantage of several features of Pandoc’s Markdown, including adding citations. You can read more about adding citations in the <strong>bookdown</strong> book <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>This post will demonstrate how you can add citations. There are 3 steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Save a BibTeX file(s) in the <code>/content/post/</code> directory. The file should be a plain-text file that contains citations that generally look like this</p></li>
<li><p>Reference the BibTeX file(s) in the YAML header of your post</p></li>
<li><p>In the text of your post, reference items in BibTeX file(s) using <code>@key</code></p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Example 1: Adding citations for books or articles</h1>
<p>There are several ways to export citations for books or articles as a BibTeX file. One simple way is to use <a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> to obtain a BibTeX entry. For example, if you search for “Bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown”, you can view the citation by clicking on the quote icon underneath the entry.</p>
<p>If you then click on the BibTeX link, you will see the formatted plain text version, which you can download as a file with the .bib extension. To now cite this item in the text of your post, use the format <code>@key</code>, so <code>@xie2016bookdown</code> generates: <span class="citation">Xie (2016)</span>. Notice that you can click on the year to see the full reference.</p>
