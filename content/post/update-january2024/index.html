<p>Hello folks and happy new year! Back from my winter holidays, and after a couple of weeks of feeling quite sick, I am ready to resume my work both in teaching and reserach. With regard to this, today I would like to deviate from my usual focus on economic evaluations and focus on a more general statistical topic related to the calculation and interpretation of summary statistics for categorical data, particularly the <strong>Relative Risk</strong> and the <strong>Odds Ratio</strong>, in different contexts. Indeed, these are common measures computed within clinical trials with some binary outcome of interest (e.g. having or not having a disease) and represent also one of the simplest type of summary statistics students are introduced to in a basic statistics course. I bring this up since I am currently teaching in one such courses and I have found quite difficult to explain how to interpret these measures to students who lack a solid mathematical background. Leaving aside the actual calculation of the measures, which is trivial, it happens sometimes that students ask questions on why odds ratios can be interpreted in basically any study design context while this is not true for relative risks. Of course the answer is relatively straightforward to people who are familiar with such designs but for students I have realised myself that this is not automatic and in some cases I feel that my explanation does not reach them fully, although I am still at a loss of what I am missing. Thus, my idea to write on this blog a general example where I simulate some data to show the issues in interpreting relative risks in case-cohort study in the plainest and simplest way that I can possible think of. The hope is that, by forcing myself to write this down carefully, I will be able to identify a best way to explain and show this concept.</p>
<p>So, without further delay and with my apologies to all health economists who hoped for another post on CEA (sorry!), let me begin with presenting my example which is mostly inspired from another publibly available simulation example that can be found <a href="https://rnahumaf.github.io/Health/Statistics/Simulation.nb.html">here</a>.</p>
<div id="risks-and-relative-risks" class="section level1">
<h1>Risks and Relative Risks</h1>
<p>Let me start with setting up the notation I will use. Let’s imagine that we have a study, either a case-control or cohort study, in which the researchers are interested in estimating for a given patient population (of size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>) a Relative Risk or Odds Ratio of a specific disease condition <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>=absent,<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>=present) given the exposure status <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>=not exposed,<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>=exposed).</p>
<p>Then, we can compute an estimate for the <strong>Risk</strong> of having the disease given exposure for this population as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Risk}=P(Y=1 \mid X=1) = \frac{\sum_i \mathbb{I}(Y_i=1 \mid X_i=1)}{\sum_i \mathbb{I}(Y_i=1 \mid X_i=1) + \sum_i \mathbb{I}(Y_i=0 \mid X_i=1)},\]</span></p>
<p>that is the sum of all outcome values (remember that <span class="math inline">\(Y=1\)</span> means presence of the disease) for all patients <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,N\)</span> who are exposed (<span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span>) over the total number of exposed patients. Now, if we want the <strong>Relative Risk</strong> of having the disease for being exposed vs not exposed, then we need to compute:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{RR}=\frac{P(Y=1 \mid X=1)}{P(Y=1 \mid X=0)},\]</span></p>
<p>which corresponds to dividing the risk of having the disease when exposed to the risk when not exposed (<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>=0). Now, here things get interesting as how you interpret this quantity depends on the design of the study. Let’s assume that we have a <strong>cohort study</strong>, that is patients are sampled first based on their exposure status <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and then we observe their outcome status <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. This means that we can directly compute the two risks of having the disease when <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> and when <span class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span> since we already know their exposure status. Thus, the quantity:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Risk}_{\text{cohort}}=P(Y=1 \mid X=1),\]</span></p>
<p>effectively corresponds to the risk or probability of having the disease in the study given that exposure is observed (and similarly the same applies for <span class="math inline">\(P(Y=1 \mid X=0)\)</span>). Since the Relative Risk is simply the ratio of the two risks, then also RR can be computed and interpreted as the ratio of the two risks or, alternatively, how much more likely are exposed patients to have the disease compared to unexposed patients.</p>
<p>Things however change when we consider a different design of the study, such as a <strong>case-control study</strong>, where patients are sampled first based on their outcome status <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and then we observe their exposure status <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Indeed, under this sampling scheme, you cannot compute <span class="math inline">\(P(Y=1 \mid X=1)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(P(Y=1 \mid X=0)\)</span> since you can only know the exposure status of each patient after the outcome has been observed. What you can estimate is instead the risk of having exposure when <span class="math inline">\(Y=1\)</span> and when <span class="math inline">\(Y=0\)</span>. For example, the risk of being exposed given that patients have the disease is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Risk}_{\text{case-control}}=P(X=1 \mid Y=1) = \frac{\sum_i \mathbb{I}(X_i=1 \mid Y_i=1)}{\sum_i \mathbb{I}(X_i=1 \mid Y_i=1) + \sum_i \mathbb{I}(X_i=0 \mid Y_i=1)},\]</span></p>
<p>which of course is different from <span class="math inline">\(P(Y=1 \mid X=1)\)</span>, and similarly for <span class="math inline">\(P(X=1 \mid Y=0) \neq P(Y=1 \mid X=0)\)</span>. Thus, also the Relative Risk derived based on these probabilities:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{RR}=\frac{P(X=1 \mid Y=1)}{P(X=1 \mid Y=0)},\]</span></p>
<p>does not correspond to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{P(Y=1 \mid X=1)}{P(Y=1 \mid X=0)}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="odds-and-odds-ratios" class="section level1">
<h1>Odds and Odds Ratios</h1>
<p>When referring to odds and Odds Ratios, instead, the situation is different due to the different nature of the computed measures. Indeed, the <strong>Odds</strong> of having the disease when exposed is the <em>ratio between the probability of having the disease and the probability of not having the disease when exposed</em>. In formulae, this is expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Odds}=\frac{P(Y=1 \mid X=1)}{P(Y=0 \mid X=1)},\]</span></p>
<p>which is always interpreted in relative terms, that is as how much more chance you have of having the disease compared to not having the disease given that you are exposed. From this, we can derive the formula of the <strong>Odds Ratio</strong> of having the disease which corresponds to the ratio of the odds for having the disease when exposed vs when unexposed:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{OR}=\frac{\frac{P(Y=1 \mid X=1)}{P(Y=0 \mid X=1)}}{\frac{P(Y=1 \mid X=0)}{P(Y=0 \mid X=0)}},\]</span></p>
<p>which is interpreted as how many more odds you have of having the disease when exposed compared to when unexposed.</p>
<p>In the context of a <strong>cohort study</strong>, we can immediately see that, given that we first sample patients based on their exposure status <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, the OR can be directly interpreted without any issues since we can estimate all odds within the ratio. In the context of a <strong>case-control study</strong>, let us consider the odds of having the disease given that patients are exposed:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Odds}_{\text{case-control}}=\frac{P(Y=1 \mid X=1)}{P(Y=0 \mid X=1)},\]</span></p>
<p>whose numerator and denominator can also be re-expressed using the conditional probability rule as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(Y=1 \mid X=1)= \frac{P(Y=1)P(X=1 \mid Y=1)}{P(X=1)} \;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\; P(Y=0 \mid X=1)= \frac{P(Y=0)P(X=1 \mid Y=0)}{P(X=1)}\]</span></p>
<p>which leads to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Odds(X=1)}_{\text{case-control}}=\frac{\frac{P(Y=1)P(X=1 \mid Y=1)}{P(X=1)}}{\frac{P(Y=0)P(X=1 \mid Y=0)}{P(X=1)}},\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, for the odds of being exposed given that the patients did not have the disease are:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Odds(X=0)}_{\text{case-control}}=\frac{\frac{P(Y=1)P(X=0 \mid Y=1)}{P(X=0)}}{\frac{P(Y=0)P(X=0 \mid Y=0)}{P(X=0)}},\]</span></p>
<p>If we then calculate the Odds Ratio we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{OR}_{\text{case-control}}=\frac{\frac{P(Y=1 \mid X=1)}{P(Y=0 \mid X=1)}}{\frac{P(Y=1 \mid X=0)}{P(Y=0 \mid X=0)}}=\frac{\frac{\frac{P(Y=1)P(X=1 \mid Y=1)}{P(X=1)}}{\frac{P(Y=0)P(X=1 \mid Y=0)}{P(X=1)}}}{\frac{\frac{P(Y=1)P(X=0 \mid Y=1)}{P(X=0)}}{\frac{P(Y=0)P(X=0 \mid Y=0)}{P(X=0)}}} = \frac{\frac{P(X=1 \mid Y=1)}{P(X=1 \mid Y=0)}}{\frac{P(X=0 \mid Y=1)}{P(X=0 \mid Y=0)}} = \frac{\frac{P(X=1 \mid Y=1)}{P(X=0 \mid Y=1)}}{\frac{P(X=1 \mid Y=0)}{P(X=0 \mid Y=0)}}.\]</span></p>
<p>The above formula shows how the OR can also be calculated based on <span class="math inline">\(P(X=1 \mid Y=1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(X=0 \mid Y=1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(X=1 \mid Y=0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(X=0 \mid Y=0)\)</span>, that is the probabilities of having a specific exposure status <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> given the outcome status <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, which are directly available in a case-control study. Therefore, the OR is an effect size measure that is adequate for both case-control and cohort designs, because they all measure the same thing.</p>

<div id="example" class="section level1">
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>Here I will try to empirically show the differences between RR and OR in a hypothetical scenario. First I generate data for a population of 1 million people, and this population will be divided in 25% who smoke and 75% who do not smoke, where smoking is the exposure variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. I set a RR of 2 when considering the probability of someone who smokes to get cancer, the disease variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Thus, I set 5% of the smoking population to have cancer, and 2.5% of the nonsmoking population to have cancer.</p>

<p>To simulate a cohort study we need to draw a sample from this population.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Determine sample size with alpha = 5% and power = 80%
sample.size &lt;- power.prop.test(p1 = 0.02, p2 = 0.01, power = 0.8)

# Now let&#39;s draw this amount of patients from each condition in our dataset.
## Draw a sample from smokers (we still don&#39;t know if they will get cancer or not)
sample.smokes &lt;- pop[which(pop$smoke==&quot;Smokes&quot;),][sample(c(1:sum(pop$smoke==&quot;Smokes&quot;)), sample.size$n, replace = F),]

<pre><code># [1] 1.758621</code></pre>
<p>We see that everytime this script is run, it returns a different value for RR. This is because sampling error occurs, that is why alpha is 5% and power is 80%. We expect a rate of false positives and false negatives.
We can plot the differences in RR after 100 different measurements (which is equivalent to 100 different studies looking at the same population, each one finding a different RR value.</p>

<p>Now, let’s proceed to get the estimate of the OR in a case-control simulation. For a case-control study, we draw a sample from random people who have cancer, and the same number of people who do not have cancer, and check if they have smoked or not in the past.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s compare the OR and the RR obtained previously.</p>

<p>We can see very clearly than under optimal circumstances, the OR is very close to the RR, which in turn is a good, but far from perfect, estimate of the true risk. Not let’s try something forbidden by the rules of statistics. The Risk Ratio should not be calculated using a case-control design, but let’s do it here to show what it produces. Additionally, I will calculate an OR from the cohort study as well.</p>

<p>This shows something really interesting. We can see that the distributions of the “allowed” calculations are all similar, and they wander around the true risk figure. However, the “forbidden” calculation, which is the RR in a case-control study, has a really narrow distribution of values that never get close to the true figure.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Here I tried to explain in a visual and a theoretical way why the OR is an effect size measurement that can be calculated in either a cohort or a case-control study, because they are mathematically the same. However, the RR can only be calculated using a cohort study design, while a case-control will only be able to offer an OR, and that is mathematically true.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will make things easier to understand for my students!</p>
