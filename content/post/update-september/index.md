With the approaching of the new academic here I have received some good news for my most recently submitted paper on Bayesian parametric modelling in health economics for missing longitudinal data, which at the moment is only available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07147).

I am happy to announce that, after a couple of rounds of reviews, the paper has been finally accepted for publication in [JSS: Series A](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1467985X). I believe that the reviewers provided a very nice feedback for improving the work and I am quite satisfied with the final version of the article which, I hope, will be of interest for anyone involved in the analsysi of partially-observed longitudinal data. I hope the pre-print of the paper will be available soon and I will "advertise" my work in two conferences in the next couple of months, where I will present the content of the paper, namely [ICTMC](https://ictmc2019.com/) this October in Brighton, and [ISPOR Europe](http://www.ispor.org/conferences-education/conferences/upcoming-conferences/ispor-europe-2019) this November in Copenhagen.

I am really excited about this paper which represented the last part of my PhD thesis and on which I worked really hard in the last year of my studies. [Here](https://agabrioblog.onrender.com/project/missing-data/) you can find a general summary of the content of the article, while [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/sites/statistics/files/presentation_priment_1.pdf) there are some slides that describe the main idea behind the proposed model.   

I just want to conlcude with some thanks with my co-authors of the paper, [Michael](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~daniels/) and [Ginaluca](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/people/gianlucabaio), without whom I would have not been able to write this paper. This was my first work with Mike, with whom I had a wonderful collaboration and I was able to visit the beatiful city of [Gainesville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida) (FL) during my first visiting period at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) (see thumbnail picture). I hope this will be the first of many works together in the furture!.
