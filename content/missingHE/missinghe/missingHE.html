<p>The focus of this simple tutorial is to provide a brief introduction and overview about how to fit Bayesian models using <code>STAN</code> via <code>R</code>.</p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>The latest version of <code>R</code>, which can be downloaded and installed for Windows, Mac or Linux OS from the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/%7D">CRAN</a> website</li>
<li>I also <strong>strongly</strong> recommend to download and install <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">Rstudio</a>, an integrated development environment which provides an “user-friendly” interaction with <code>R</code> (e.g. many drop-down menus, tabs, customisation options)</li>
</ul>
