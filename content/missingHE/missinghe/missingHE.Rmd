The focus of this simple tutorial is to provide a brief introduction and overview about how to fit Bayesian models using `STAN` via `R`.

Prerequisites:

* The latest version of `R`, which can be downloaded and installed for Windows, Mac or Linux OS from the [CRAN](https://www.r-project.org/}) website
* I also **strongly** recommend to download and install [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), an integrated development environment which provides an "user-friendly" interaction with `R` (e.g. many drop-down menus, tabs, customisation options)
